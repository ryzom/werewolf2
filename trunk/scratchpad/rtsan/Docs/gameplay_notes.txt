Idea 1:
	Let the players play outside the valley before the curse is lifted or even before there is a quest to lift the curse. Players will be just able to create characters that live outside the valley. This will show people the situation outside on how much having orich. would change things (for the better). Every merchant is willing to pay big bucks for a lil orich. Ships would come again and people would have contact with the outside world etc. This hopefully would make the players more compelled to free the village in a way that keeps the possiblity of orich. trade.
