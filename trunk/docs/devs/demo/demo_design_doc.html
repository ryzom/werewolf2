<h1>Werewolf Tech Demo</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Werewolf Tech Demo is a simple spear throwing technology demo that will show 
  off the capabilities of the <a href=http://www.nevrax.org">NeL</a> MMORG framework 
  as implemented by the team at Ironic Entertainment. The demo is meant to be 
  a visually pleasing, a relatively fun gaming experience which will require a 
  minimal amount of balancing while still testing our technology's implementation. 
  The essence of the demo is a spear throwing contest where players try to heave 
  a spear further than other players. Players have a few basic stats which improve 
  over time. Additionally, players will be able to join guilds where the guilds 
  are able to compete against each other based upon their member's performance. 
  Players will have their rankings published on a web site and the current distance 
  champion gets to wear a special armor denoting their preeminence among their 
  peers.

<h5>Setting</h5>
The setting is on a somewhat large island in the middle of a very large lake. 
On the island resides a large forest of primarily fir trees although there are 
other types of trees too. On the island there is a little laft style hunting lodge 
where the players can rest and drink some ale. If there is time we may implement 
a bar keep to keep the ales coming. In back of the house there is a small pond 
where the players can sit around and watch the other players compete in the spear 
throwing contest.

<h5><a name="demomilest">Demo Development Roadmap</a></h5>

<p>Milestone 001
<ul>
  <li>Concept artwork (character and architectural)
begins as well as subject research. A rough map of of the area in which
the demo will occur should be drawn.</li>
  <li>Documenation describing the
general look and feel of the game, gameplay description, art guidelines
as well as hardware requirements.</li>
  <li>Client visual GUI concept complete.</li>
  <li>Pre-alpha version of the Maya Exporter is to be complete
(without
landscape export functionality [landscape export dev will occur after
the demo]).
  <li>Client framework is up including GUI functionality,
keyboard control and the ability to render basic scenes (i.e.
snowballs) via a controllable camera.</li>
  <li>Basic documentation with respect to the
Demo is complete (this doesn't include recruitment tools, web site
etc.). 
</ul>

Milestone 002
<ul>
  <li>Concept artwork completed near the begnining of
this phase.
    <li>Modeling of meshes begins as does texture painting and
skinning begins.
    <li>Work on nonpersistent basic server services begins
(i.e. login services, basic connectivity and chat).
    <li>Client is able to
connect to the server, login, and perform basic movement, chat and
logout.</li>
    <li>Server database design and prototype is complete.
    <li>Matte
painting may also begin at this phase.
</ul>

Milestone 003
<ul>
  <li>Client now has advanced GUI features including an
on screen HUD as conceptualized in Milestone 001 although functionality
attached to widgets has not been implemented (buttons may contain stubs
for actions associated with buttons).</li>
  <li>DB is connected to appropriate
server services. Initial data /character persistence is achieved.</li>
  <li>Environmental artwork is approximately half complete (i.e.
landscape,
forest and laft house art assets).</li>
  <li>Basic Male Warrior is largely
complete (modeled, textured and skinned) with some very basic
animations complete (walk, run and sit).</li>
  <li>Maya exporter bug
squashing.<br>
</ul>

Milestone 004 (Closed Alpha Testing)
<ul>
  <li>Client now has all major functionality required
from the game.
  <li>Environmental assets are approximately two thirds
complete.
  <li>Clan functionality is integrated into the servers and
clients.
  <li>Clan artwork (crests etc.) are completed.</li>
  <li>Recruiting web site is begun as well as recruiting documents and portfolios.
  <li>Promotional materials are readied for sponsorship
requests.
  <li>Character avatar is complete.&nbsp; (If there is time a
female avatar may be created.)</li>
  <li>Team members test the game and Demo Parties become a regular
event where the team plays the demo for fun and also to spot bugs.<br>
</ul>

Milestone 005 (Closed Alpha Testing Continues)
<ul>
  <li>Client and server are functionally complete.
  <li>All art assets have been completed.
  <li>Limited alpha
released to certain a small circle of trusted testers.
  <li>All matte
paintings are complete.
  <li>Server and client QA, bug squashing and stress testing.&nbsp; The stress test&nbsp; includes network subsystems, rendering subsystems, DB subsystems&nbsp; Coding teams will coordinate and optimize their respective subsections (optimization will likely include media).&nbsp; These stress tests will likely constitute a small group of outside testers.
</ul>

Milestone 006 (Closed Beta)
<ul>
  <li>Beta testers group is expanded to include people from outside the team.
  <li>More testing and refactoring of code and environmental assets.
</ul>

Milestone 007 (Open Beta)
<ul>
  <li>Beta testing is open to anyone who would like to test.
  <li>Web portal
for players to visit and use to log in to the demo.
  <li>Web site for the demo is complete (with forums) as
is the recruiting area of the web site. <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Operation Pimp Werewolf</span> begins now...&nbsp; Spread the word to all the old familiar places where developers hang out concerning the demo.
</ul>

Milestone 007 (Release of the Demo)
<ul>
  <li>Release demo and buy each other massive quantities of beer and consume said beer.
  <li>Drink more beer so we don't have to think about all the bugs the players are abusing.
  <li>Evangelize the demo and ramp up newcomers.
</ul>

Milestone 009
<ul>
  <li>Bug squashing and postmortem.
  <li>v1.1 release (if required)
