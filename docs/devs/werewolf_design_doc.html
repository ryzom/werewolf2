<h4>Game Description:</h4>
<div class="indent1"> Werewolf is an online role playing game set in
the small nordic village of Laurelin. Laurelin sits in a valley which
is encircled by impassable mountains on all sides save to the eastern.
The valley is occupied by a large and ominous forest now full of
menacing creatures. Players must work together to provide the
essentials of life to avoid being killed by creatures in the forest or
other players who can transform themselves into a werewolf. Ultimately
the players must work to find the source of the evil which pervades the
forest around them so life can resume normally in Laurelin. What makes
Werewolf stand out is its emphasis on traditional role playing and use
of a third party production tested MORG engine (<a

<h2><a name="foreword">II. Foreword</a></h2>
This is a living document and can/will change without notice. Currently
this document is a very rough draft and we haven't had a chance to
include all the ideas we have for Werewolf. If you feel we've left
anything out or you find something that is just plain wrong please send

 href="http://code-bear.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/werewolf_dev">mailing
list</a>.
<h2><a name="overview">III. Overview</a></h2>
<p>Werewolf is a self-published multiplayer online role-playing game (MORG) initially 
  set in the ancient nordic village of Laurelin. Werewolf seeks to return RPGs 
  to their roots by fostering a community of role playing only servers. In almost 
  all MORGs (Everquest, Dark Age of Camelot, etc.) inevitably a devoted contingent 
  of players who yearn for a true "role-playing game" attempt to role-play under 
  these less than ideal circumstances. Unfortunately until recently little could 
  be done as creating a MORG has always been out of reach to all but the largest 
  studios, until now. Traditional game publishers and studios have been unwilling 
  to properly service this sector of their player base as to them the number of 
  players is undoubtably too small to be worth their time and money. Werewolf 
  seeks to fill the "true" role playing niche where the larger MORGs cannot. The 
  gaming industry has consolidated towards ever more ambitious and expensive development 
  efforts. Full Moon Studios seeks to take advantage of this trend by self publishing 
  Werewolf and creating a game of, by and for role playing enthusiasts. 
<p>Utilizing NeL (a MORG Engine produced by Nevrax) Full Moon Studios will create 
  a radically different gaming experience for role-playing enthusiasts built NeL's 
  proven technology. NeL is already used in a production environment as the engine 
  upon which the popular MORG "The Saga of Ryzom" was created by Nevrax. Nevrax 
  has generously donated NeL under the terms of the GPL allowing Full Moon Studios 
  to build on NeL's strong foundation. 
<h3>Setting</h3>
The game is set on a large island (100sq km?) in the middle of an isolated valley. 
The valley is surrounded on three sides by impassable mountains. Until recently 
there has been access to the village from the southern side via the river which 
runs north and south along the map. Not very long ago there was a large earthquake 
which cause a waterfall to form and make our village impassable via the river. 
<div class="image">

 src="../../media/concept-artwork/village/maps/areamap_sm.png"><br>
	<a href="../../media/concept-artwork/village/maps/areamap.png">Full Size Map</a>
</div>

There used to be a secondary access route to the village which involved a road 
which approaches from the west and winds through a narrow pass until it reaches 
the village. This route has been eliminated as well because of the wild beasts 
which now lurk in the forest and make the road impassable. The road which is now 
unused is unmaintained and the forest has overgrown the road to a great extent. 
<h4>Laurelin</h4>
<p>Laurelin is a beautiful but quaint village which is nestled in the center of 
  a valley surrounded by lofty peaks and the immense forest, the Vargskogen. Laurelin 
  stands on a relatively large but difficult to find island. Hidden from the cares 
  of the rest of the world by its remote location life in Laurelin was slow and 
  peaceful. With such an ideallic existence and ample amounts of free time the 
  residents of Laurelin were free to hone and improve their respective crafts 
  to levels unheard of throughout the world. There was never a shortage of raw 
  materials or even metals flowed from the surrounding mountains in plenty. The 
  craftsmen of Laurelin had honed their craft for centuries until they were unparalleled 
  artisans and held without rival in the respected craft among all the lands. 
  Soon the artisans of the village learned that the outside world would pay handsomely 
  for the unparalleled beauty of the goods wrought by their hands. Merchants would 
  travel great distances and brave many perils to obtain the handywork of Laurelin 
  craftsmen as merchants knew they could always fetch a handsome fee for their 
  trouble. </p>
<p>The most famous (and popular) building in the village is "The Wolf's Den Inn 
  and Tavern". This tavern like any other self respecting establishment has an 
  inn attached to it as well as a small stable for traveler's horses though this 
  goes largely unused nowadays. During the glory years of Laurelin "The Wolf's 
  Den Tavern and Inn" was renowned for the quality of the ale on tap as well as 
  the luxurious accommodations provided by the Inn. The Wolf's Den was frequented 
  by the town's people for the fine ale and news/gossip they could recieve from 
  a nice evening in the tavern. The Wolf's Den was also visited by the rich merchants 
  who were always about town on business. There was one other group who loved 
  to visit The Wolf's Den and that was the aristocrats who enjoyed visiting for 
  a taste of country life, its unrivaled craftsmen, beautiful scenery and the 
  hospitality of the inn and the people of the village. The inn and tavern is 
  particularly beautifully decorated in keeping with the high expectations of 
  its visitors. While the tavern's business certainly isn't what it once was when 
  rich merchants and powerful aristocrats used to frequent "The Wolf's Den" (often 
  referred to as just "The Den" by village residents). "The Den" is still able 
  to maintain a very respectable level of patronage by the locals looking for 
  a chat with other villagers to discuss their misery and to drown their sadness 
  in the bottom of a mug of ale. Through the town's misfortune "The Den's" owner 
  the barkeep is still able to make a respectable living. "The Den" is by far 
  the best kept up building in the whole village. Indeed ever better maintained 
  that the Magistrate's office. When the residents of Laurelin visit "The Den" 
  they are reminded of better times by the Inn's beautiful and unchanged appearance. 
</p>
<h3>Surrounding Area</h3>
<h4>The Vargskogen</h4>
<p>This ancient and dense forest of fir trees spans for several kilometers all 
  about Laurelin. The Vargskogen ("Wood of the Wolf") runs along the valley and 
  finally up the mountains until they are strangled by the height and stone. Just 
  outside the village the Vargskogen is almost pleasant but very distantly, especially 
  in the evening an eerie green glow eminates from the heart of the forest. Of 
  the several brave villagers who have tried to find a way out of the forest very 
  few have returned. Of the handful who made it back to the village they tell 
  tales that few can believe. One of unnatural abominations feasting on the flesh 
  of other unnameable animals. They say the further you venture into the forest 
  the mists get ever thicker until you can hardly see twenty meters in front of 
  you. As you draw further into the forest green lights dance around you and strange 
  noises seem to dance around you and all the while you get the distinct impression 
  somehow that you are not wanted in the forest. What lies even further in the 
  forest is anyones guess. No one has yet been able to venture more than a half 
  a kilometer into the forest and make it back to tell the tale.</p>
<p>As evil as the forest has become as of late, ages ago it was as brilliant as 
  it is ominous today. The forest was once a place of legendary beauty and in 
  ancient times was known as the Elorduin (The Golden Forest). In ancient times 
  just the mere mention of the Elorduin would bring to mind many tales and legends 
  that parents would tell to their children, and to their friends in gathering 
  places. The Elorduin was always a forest full of mists due to the rivers and 
  many waterfalls which surrounded and ran through the forest. The golden sun 
  would shine down through the mists and fog giving the forest a golden appearance 
  and hence its name. </p>
<h4>The Silverberg (Kelebrim)</h4>
Mountain range surrounding the valley of Aerendal where Laurelin dwells. This 
mountain range is named for the tallest peak in the range, "Silver Throne". The 
Silverberg surrounds Aerendal and Laurelin on all sides except the eastern side 
where there is a pass. 
<h4>Silver Throne (Silfr Arkham)</h4>
The tallest peak in the Silverberg.  Silver Throne is the largest mountain in the Silverberg mountain range.  Silver throne gets its name from what appears to be a throne carved high in the mountain's side.  It is said that the gods live upon the mountain and that Odin (or whomever) is seated on the throne during periods of cloud cover or heavy snow (which is often).

<h4>Aerindal</h4>
Literally "The Holy Valley" this is the valley in which Laurelin dwells.  Its name was derived from thousands of years ago when the Vargfolk inhabited the valley and the seers tended to refer to this valley informally as "The Holy Valley" so as not to use its actual name out of reverence for the Vargfolk. (maybe Tolothon "golden pine")

<h4>Falls of Valros</h4>
These falls are the largest in Aerindal. These falls plunge many thousands of 
feet from the base of Silver Throne and <TODO> mountains down into Aerindal. The 
falls were a popular tourist attraction because of their beauty and the nice trails 
which lead directly to the lake and the base of the falls. Because of the extreme 
altitude of the plunge of these falls the water is absolutely ice cold even during 
the heart of summer. 
<h4>Lake Valere</h4>
This is essentially the tidal pool for the Falls of Valros which is large enough to be called a lake.  Don't know too much about it other than it is "pretty big". :-P


<h2><a name="storyline">IV. Storyline</a></h2>
At one time the village of Laurelin was a paradise nestled deeply on a remote 
island surrounded by lofty peaks and the immense forest the Vargskogen. Hidden 
from the cares of the rest of the world by it's remote location life in Laurelin 
was slow and peaceful. With such an ideallic existence and ample amounts of free 
time the residents of Laurelin were free to hone and improve their respective 
crafts to levels unheard of throughout the world. Merchants would travel great 
distances to obtain the handywork of Laurelin as merchants knew they could always 
fetch a handsome fee for their trouble. The craftsmen of Laurelin had for centuries 
honed their craft until they were unparalleled artisans and held without rival 
in the respected craft. Soon the artisans of the village learned that the outside 
world would pay handsomely for the unparalleled beauty of the goods wrought by 
the Laurelin craftsmen. 
<p>Aided by the fame of the craftspeople, Laurelin's natural beauty, and the friendly 
  inhabitants a somewhat small but profitable tourist trade flourished. Often 
  merchants traveling to the village would bring their families to mix business 
  with pleasure and stay for extended visits to enjoy the quaint charms of Laurelin. 
  Rich aristocrats would often visit for extended visits drawn by the quiet country 
  life, the famous "Wolf's Den Inn &amp; Tavern" or sometimes just to take a small 
  detour to visit the village for a few days of shopping along their way to another 
  destination. Yet lately things have taken an ill turn and all is not well in 
  Laurelin. Nature itself seems to have turned against the sleepy little village.</p>
<p>A spirit of darkness and evil malice has crept into the forest and
vile beasts have filled the forest even before anyone took notice. Now
no one comes to Laurelin for any reason whether great or small because
of the evil beasts that roam the woods and the great road into town.
The road to town has been unmaintained for quite some time and the only
way in and out of town has been overrun by nature. The once prospering
artisan trade that kept the town so busy has dried up and the village
has begun to founder. Things seem to grow from bad to worse in the
village and hope that the village will be rescued grows dimmer with
every passing day. Evil creatures which now infest the forest have been
seen roaming the outskirts of town. Last night the most evil deed yet
had befallen the sleepy village of Laurelin and one of Laurelin's most
well beloved residents was slain. Poor ...<todo> was asleep in his own
bed last night when some wild creature crept into his home and slew him
as he slept. A few villagers claimed to have seen a wolflike creature
of dread size running away from Tom's house. Mary Tuckborough even
claimed to have seen the animal change back into a human form though
she couldn't say who it was the wolf changed back into.</todo></p>
<p>Evil tales as ancient as the village itself have once again become a
popular topic of conversation in town. The elders of the village tell
tales of men who can change into the form of a wolf. These creatures
have a seemingly insatiable bloodlust and will not stop until every
living thing for miles around has been slain. How will this dread
creature be stopped? The town elders have decided to hold a vote on who
they should execute for these murders. Undoubtedly there will be
innocents accidentally killed but it's better than waiting for the
terrible beast to slaughter the whole town.</p>
<p>Word has reached Laurelin that merchant caravans have dared to attempt the 
  now perilous trek into the village to rescue a limited number of villagers and 
  to deliver much needed supplies to those who must stay behind. You knew the 
  journey into the evil forest called Vargskogen would be dangerous but you had 
  no idea what you were getting into. Your caravan was heavily armed but you soon 
  found out that swords alone were no match for the terror and savagery you encountered 
  in the forest. As your caravan began its journey all began well for the first 
  day of the seven day trek. However on the second evening and every night thereafter 
  when the caravan would halt for the evening unspeakable animals from the forest 
  would take the brave men of your caravan and drag them into the forest screaming 
  despite large fires and a heavy guard set about the camp. Your caravan had almost 
  arrived in the village when an onslaught of creatures attacked the caravan and 
  slaughtered everyone around you. You ran through the forest and somehow have 
  managed to stay just ahead of the creatures pursuing you. You finally arrive 
  in the village of Laurelin haggard, hungry and exhausted beyond human endurance. 
</p>
<p>Acts of beasts killing villagers has been taking place for quite some time 
  now. Your fellow villagers are outraged at this turn of events and will stop 
  at nothing to destroy the foul creatures causing this chaos. But the question 
  remains: Who (or what) is responsible for these horrid acts? Some of your fellow 
  villagers have come forward claiming to have a special vision that allows them 
  to see these murders taking place. Do these so-called seers know what is happening? 
  Or are they just covering their own tracks with these obviously demonic visions? 
  The decision lies with you, but you had best discover the truth quickly. The 
  local magistrate has launched an investigation into the matter but there has 
  been little progress. The situation is desperate. In order to restore faith 
  in the town's officials and hopefully to end the town's woes the town's officials 
  have begun executing people whom they believe to be a werewolf. The magistrate 
  has bowed to the mob mentality of the town regarding this crisis and has instituted 
  daily votes on who the people of the village believe is a werewolf. Whomever 
  is voted to be the most likely person to be a werewolf is executed for the good 
  of the village. </p>
<p>The players roam freely throughout the village. They can converse
with other players and try to make alliances. At some point in the day
they must stop by the Magistrate's office and cast their vote for whom
they believe to be a werewolf. Seers and Werewolf do exactly the same
as the villagers in the day. At some point in the day, the Magistrate
will appear in the town square and announce the results of the daily
vote. The player with the most votes will be summoned to the front and
executed.<br>
At night all of the villagers are asleep. The werewolves stalk the
streets hunting for a victim. Seers can select any villager to have
visions about which allows them to see if the subject of interest is a
werewolf.</p>
<h2><a name="gameplay">V. Gameplay</a></h2>
Player's main goal in Werewolf is to simply survive the next day. Every
day that the player is logged in and lives (without being bitten) the
player gets a survival point. These survival points can then be spent
to aquire (or improve) various skills. When a skill is first aquired
the player isn't very good at the skill. To improve the player's chance
at success of performing a skill he has trained he can either practice
the skill (which will improve their base attribites as well) or spend
survival points to improve their skill.

Karufin is a portly fellow who presides over the affairs of Laurelin.
He is an overly plump and jovial fellow who tries to put the best face
on a bad situation though he fears for the future of his town. He is
usually fairly well dressed and bears a ceremonial horn to denote the
status of his office which he blows every evening at 9PM to remind the
villagers that the evening hour has arrived (as of late it is
additionally a warning that everyone should get indoors).

<span class="quote">
"Welcome stranger to my humble tavern 'The Wolf's Den.' If you need
anything at all don't hesitate to ask either myself or my staff!"
</span>
<p>The barkeep is the owner and proprietor of his tavern "The Wolf's
Den". The barkeep is a tall but trim fellow no doubt kept fit by
running after his customer's every whim. He's a relatively good looking
fellow and is a gregarious fellow who certainly can hold up his end of
a conversation. His family has owned "The Wolf's Den" for generations
and Berrin sees it as his duty to help the people of the village
through this difficult time by providing them with a friendly place to
come and forget their troubles if only for an hour or two each day.
Berrin's wife died a few years ago when she ventured out of town for
supplies for the inn and never returned. It is rumored that she never
made it even so far as out of the great forest that surrounds Laurelin
before she was taken by beasts of the forest. This was a harbinger of
evil times yet to come to Laurelin. Ever since this dread event no one
in Laurelin has tried their luck on the road out of town.</p>
<p>Berrin is a devoted father and does his best for his daughter who is
twenty one years old and with his son who is just ten now. He's
extremely close with his daughter Lissa as he's leaned on her heavily
to help run the Den. Although she doesn't know it she's helped her
father get through his grief.

"I love my father and brother more than anything in the world. We've
always gotten through hard times by taking care of one another. This

Lissa is the daughter of Berrin, the owner of "The Wolf's Den Inn and Tavern." 
Lissa's beauty and her beauty is striking and she has a certain graceful bearing 
which makes her all the more beautiful to behold. She's been proposed by just 
about every eligible bachelor in town yet she has turned them all down. She is 
a woman of great intelligence and discerment and she knew that with hard times 
coming upon the village that the best place for her in the forseeable future is 
with her father in the tavern. Most townspeople (including most of her previous 
suitors) are barely able to meet end's meet so she plans on staying on at "The 
Wolf's Den" for as long as this crisis lasts. Unfortunately for the past few years 
she has grown up without the help of her mother around the inn. Even with the 
light traffic the tavern has experienced lately she is very busy doing both her 
work as well as the work her mother used to do and help take care of her little 
brother. Despite this she does find time to socialize with the patrons of the 
tavern as it's good for business.

</span><br>
The bar keep's son is a young lad of ten. Faeold is a typical ten year
old young boy who is full of life and energy. He's very trusting and
friendly to all and likes to talk quite a bit. He plays with the other
children in town but does all he can to help his father look after the
guests. He has sandy blonde hair with brown eyes and a few traces of
freckles running down both sides of his nose.

was it that you wanted again?"
</span><br>
Kesil is quite positive and grimly set on the notion that everyone in
town will perish. He is a lanky fellow and has a downtrodden
appearance. There are many lines of care chiseled into his face and
dark circles around his eyes as one who has spent many sleepless nights
pondering some unfathomable terror. Kesil's business has been downright
awful as of late as people can only afford to buy the more barest of
necessities. To make matters worse he has been forced to grow or make
most of what he sells in his shop nowadays since he has long been
unable to get fresh supplies for his store since the road into town has
been blocked. Because of the plight of the village he's almost
downright unfriendly to everyone but especially so to strangers.

<h2><a name="setting">VI. Setting Description</a></h2>
<h5><a name="village"></a>The Village of Laurelin</h5>
Laurelin is an ancient nordic style village with a long and relatively uneventful 
history. Lately Laurelin has fallen on hard times. A light fog now lies upon the 
entire town but the fog is most thick in the evenings and especially in the forest 
that surrounds the town. An ominous dark cloud cover hangs over the village almost 
every day. As you go deeper into the dense woods that surround the village you 
can barely see your hand in front of your face and evil creatures can be heard 
stirring around you. Entering the forest is certain death for a villager as they 
will be attacked by some unnamable creature of darkness. The cobblestone streets 
of Laurelin are as well lit as they may be by oil lanterns which the magistrate 
lights every evening after sundown. 
<p>The homes of Laurelin stood unchanged for ages. These sturdy laft style log 
  homes constructed entirely of wood have thatch and sod roofs. These old homes 
  recall visions of happier times in Laurelin despite their ancient appearance. 
  Ornately carved wooden pillars are featured on the front of each building. Also, 
  many fluted joints, ornate decorations and expert woodworking are featured on 
  each house. The village is bisected by The Great River that flows briskly by. 
  At this point in its progress to the sea the river ranges from 15-20 meters 
  in width. The river can be crossed easily by the famous "Great Bridge" which 
  is ancient beyond memory of its creation. The bridge is constructed of ornately 
  detailed hardwood. The Bridge is wide enough to allow for two large wagons to 
  ride its length side by side and still have ample room between them.</p>
<h5><a name="ancient_history"></a>Laurelin - Ancient History (3000-1000
years ago)</h5>
The beginnings of Laurelin is shrowded in the mists of time. It is
generally agreed that it began as a small town that serviced the lumber
trade and later the very lucrative mining trade. Early in the morning
one could always hear the sawmills operating and the small number of
skilled craftspeople that the village busily plying their trade. As
more people moved into the area to help with the lumber trade it didn't
take long for the inhabitants to discover that the area had rich gold,
silver, copper and mercury deposits. When word of the discovery of rich
mineral deposits leaked out from the village it brought a number of
prospecters seeking their fortunes. While the word of such rich mineral
deposits did increase the village's population the remote location of
the village kept all but the most determined and hardy prospectors
away. Still, the lure of possible riches of silver and gold lured a
number of pioneers swelled the population of Laurelin. Great opulence
and wealth flowed from the city at this the noontide of Laurelin.
Laurelin lived for centuries beyond count in this way, harvesting
timber from the forest and the rich metals from the ground.
<p>This growth in the village's population created an even greater need
for the products and services that the various craftspeople of the
village provided. The craftspeople of the town were well prepared to
provide all that the new inhabitants and more. The craftspeople of
Laurelin had been practicing their trade many hundreds of years passing
down their knowledge from generation to generation. Since there was
precious little else to do in the remote village other than to practice
their trade for profit and for their own amusement over a period of
hundreds of years the craftspeople of Laurelin slowly became the most
skilled craftspeople in all of Levbolne. The craftspeople were known
for their work's durability and attention to detail.</p>
<p>One day in the mines by pure chance some of the villagers mining
discovered a mysterious metal which they had never seen the like of
before. Later this strange metal came to be know as orichalcum. After
consulting with the village elders and the craftspeople it was
ascertained that orichalcum is a metal with very strange and magical
properties. Through testing it was discovered that orichalcum can store
varying amounts of magic depending on the purity of the sample. Purer
strains of orichalcum can contain vast quantities of very powerful
magic and even give off an ethereal blueish glow. Orichalum of this
level of purity was long ago mined out of existence and it is barely
remembered in the tales of the village elders. Most people discount
this as a mere legend and a story that parents tell their children at
night as a bedtime fable.</p>
<p>Many of Laurelin's ancient legends stem from this ancient time period. Some 
  thought to be more true than others. None however compare in horror to the fabled 
  invasion of the ravening wolves. The wolves are said to have come down from 
  the mountains and overrun the village one night killing scores of villagers, 
  tourists and craftsmen. The wolves returned once every month for three months. 
  Eventually it was decided that the bridge which crossed the river had to be 
  burned to keep the wolves from entirely destroying the town. The town's people 
  eventually created a hunting party to find the wolves and exterminate them. 
  It is said that the hunting party found an enormous den of hundreds of large 
  wolves. The den was said to be strewn bones with the bones of the pack's victims. 
  After a long and dangerous hunt eventually all of the ravening wolves were hunted 
  and exterminated. The returning members of the hunting party were hailed as 
  heroes and there was a great feast in the town hall at that time.</p>
<p>Never again did the ravening wolves trouble the sleepy little village of Laurelin. 
  In fact it is said that the spirits of the ravening wolves to make up for their 
  murdering rampage watch over the village an protect it. Legend has it that sprinkled 
  among many ages are reports from villagers claimed to have witnessed the disembodied 
  spirits of the wolves slaying foul and horribly dangerous beasts that wandered 
  too close to the village. For ages and to this day the protection of the wolves 
  are said to watch over the village to this very day. Because of this the wolves 
  crimes were said to have been pardoned and to a degree forgotten in the hearts 
  and minds of the villagers. Soon because of its role as protector of village 
  the wolf was and is now revered above all other animals. Harming a wolf in any 
  way was made a serious crime and anyone hunting or killing a wolf for any reason 
  were either banished from the village or put to death. Even seeing a wolf was 
  considered a good omen. The area of the forest and mountains in which the dangerous 
  wolf pack of old were hunted and slain was declared the sacred hunting ground 
  of the wolves. No one has since been permitted to this day to enter this area 
  under pain of death. It is just as well as the area is some of the most rugged 
  and remote territory in the area.</p>
<p>Once the villagers of Laurelin were certain that the danger had
passed and confident that the wolve's protection lay over the village
construction began on a new bridge to cross the great river. The bridge
was rebuilt far more fair than it had ever been and was constructed as
a tribute to their once destroyers now turned protectors. The best
craftsmen of the village worked ceasely on the bridge and made it the
fairest thing the North Lands had ever seen. Admiration for the
fairness of the bridge is how it is said that the wolf became the main
symbol and theme seen throughout the village.</p>
<h5><a name="middle_history"></a>Laurelin - Middle History (1000-500
years ago)</h5>
These were prosperous times for Laurelin and everyone who lived in the village. 
There was a booming mineral trade (esp. for orichalculum), the lumber harvests 
were excellent and the village craftspeople never had so much business. As the 
trade between Laurelin and the outside world increased the Duke of the region 
decreed that a road should be built large enough to make the journey more easy 
for the increasing merchant traffic between Laurelin and the rest of the North 
Lands. The construction of the road took quite a few years but once it was completed 
it opened up the floodgates of trade with the outside world. Goods flowed out 
of Laurelin at an unprecidented rate as merchant caravans flowed in and out of 
Laurelin. 
<p>The fame of Laurelin grew to reach even the ears of the nobility all
over Levbolne from rich merchants who regularly visited the village.
The village's country charms, unrivaled craftsmen and the hospitality
and ale at "The Wolf's Den Inn and Tavern" made it a popular vacation
spot for the rich and powerful alike. Merchants would spends weeks in
Laurelin doing business and staying over (often times bringing their
families) for a week or so. Nobility would often stop over in Laurelin
for weeks at a time. Some nobility even used the Wolf's Den as a place
to spend their summers when they had tired of their many summer estates.</p>
<p>All of this extra traffic to the sleepy little town made it quite a bustling 
  place for a little village and created a nice tourism industry. During this 
  time the city made lots of improvements to the town adding cobblestone streets, 
  a nice garden at the center of town and generally improving the look of the 
  town. Of course all of this tourism also effected the business of the mechants 
  in a very positive way. The merchants were used to creating ornately decorated 
  works of art for more large scale projects but they quickly added smaller items 
  to their inventory which would interest the new tourists and merchants looking 
  to add a new trinket to their estates. Everything in Laurelin was going very 
  well. Timber harvests were some of the best in the village's history and many 
  miners got rich mining orichalcum. It seemed that things couldn't be better 
  for the sleepy little village. </p>
<h5><a name="recent_history"></a>Laurelin - Recent History</h5>
All of Laurelin's troubles began with the more frequent animal attacks
that occurred on the great road. The occasional animal attack wasn't
all that uncommon to begin because of the remote location in the wild
but lately the attacks have been different. The attacks used to only be
a lone animal who attacked an unwary traveller who strayed too far from
the road and came upon an animal's den/lair and was attacked out of
fear. Lately though travellers have been attacked by packs of animals
or in the event that it was a single animal the victim was maimed or
once every few years someone was even killed.
As time has passed these attacks have been increasing in frequency and
with building ferocity. Lately the attacks have been so frequent that
the flow of tourism and even merchant caravans have stopped coming.
There are so many beastly creatures running around the forest it is
treacherous to venture very far into the city and using the road into
town is unthinkable. This has had a profound effect on the economy of
Laurelin. With the flow of goods in and out of the village very
infrequent the economy is in shambles. People are struggling to gather
enough food just to survive when there is a large gap between when some
daring soul is able to make it in and out of town. Things have gone
this way in varying degrees for hundreds of years now but in the last
couple of years things have started to get desperate as evil has
seemingly enveloped the whole village.
<h5><a name="the_den"></a>The Wolf's Den Inn and Tavern</h5>
This tavern like any other self respecting establishment has an inn attached to 
it as well as a small stable for traveler's horses though this goes largely unused 
nowadays. During the glory years of Laurelin "The Wolf's Den Tavern and Inn" was 
renowned for the quality of the ale on tap as well as the luxurious accommodations 
provided by the Inn. The Wolf's Den was frequented by the town's people for the 
fine ale and news/gossip they could receive from a nice evening in the tavern. 
The Wolf's Den was also visited by the rich merchants who were always about town 
on business. There was one other group who loved to visit The Wolf's Den and that 
was the aristocrats who enjoyed visiting for a taste of country life, it's unrivaled 
craftsmen, beautiful scenery and the hospitality of the inn and the people of 
the village. The inn and tavern is particularly beautifully decorated in keeping 
with the high expectations of it's visitors. While the tavern's business certainly 
isn't what it once was when rich merchants and powerful aristocrats used to frequent 
"The Wolf's Den" (often referred to as just "The Den" by village residents). "The 
Den" is still able to maintain a very respectable level of patronage by the locals 
looking for a chat with other villagers to discuss their misery and to drown their 
sadness in the bottom of a mug of ale. Through the town's misfortune "The Den's" 
owner the barkeep is still able to make a respectable living. "The Den" is by 
far the best kept up building in the whole village. Indeed ever better maintained 
that the Magistrate's office. When the residents of Laurelin visit "The Den" they 
are reminded of better times by the Inn's beautiful and unchanged appearance. 
<h2><a name="music">VII. Music</a></h2>
<p>The music in Werewolf will be dark and ominous much like the times
in Laurelin. The instrumentation should be relatively simple consisting
of acoustic instruments and vocals. Mostly the audio tracks will be for
background music and will help denote an ominous and foreboding mood.
In addition to the game background music we will also need music for
the credits and a splash screen. When voting results are about to be
announced however the music should become more tense and quicker in
pace to help connotate excitement and also as a cue that the player
should make their way to the town square to hear the results. Also,
whenever a player strays too far out of town and starts to venture far
into the dangerous woods that surrounds the village or if the villager
strays too far along the road outside of town the music should become
tense and dangerous letting the player know that they should turn
around and head back to the village.<br>
Whenever a player enters the tavern the music should have a reassuring
quality and not contain the dark ambiance that pervades the music in
the rest of the game. The music should denote the more cheery mood in
the bar and convey to the player that this is a safe place in town from
the werewolves.</p>
<p>
The music will be encoded in OGG format 128kbs 44hz. There will be no
official recording/sequencing program that musicians should use but the
musician should provide the project with the program source file as
well as a midi file and if possible any instrument banks they've used
for their compositions.
</p>
<h2><a name="soundfx">VIII. Sound Effects</a></h2>
<p>Sound Effects should be as realistic sounding as possible. Sound
effects should be able to be heard throughout town and to a certain
extent in the depths of the forest (as Werewolves may hide out there
for a time). These sound effects that should be heard everywhere is the
sounding of the large ceremonial horn (for the announcement of the
voting results or to inform the players of the circumstances of a new
killing) as well as the blood curdling screams of victims of the
dreaded werewolves.</p>
<p>There should be lots of sound effects that will contribute to the
dark mood of Werewolf. Lots of erie and unearthly sounds can be heard
whenever someone approaches the forests or strays too far on the road
that leads outside of town. Players can hear the constant chatter of
the river that runs through the middle of town throughout a large
portion of the city.</p>
<p>There is already a very large library of sounds within the
WorldForge sound effects library. Most of the sound effects we will
need for our game barring a few special cases we will be able to use
sounds exclusively that WorldForge already possesses.</p>

</ul>
<h5><a name="artmilest">2) Art and Non-Technological Content
Development Milestones</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>Months 0-2 - Concept artwork (character and architectural), story
development, subject research, and color studies. A detailed map of
Laurelin should be drawn for the mappers to reference. Artists should
also take this time to become familiar with the tools needed to create
maps. Character scripts are written and sound effects needed for
the game are gathered. After basic gameplay decisions are made HUD
graphics begin to get created. </li>
  <li>Months 2-6 - The landscape modeling and texturing should be
complete and rough shaders created to simulate the river. By this time
a simple villager's home should be completed as well as a pine and
hardwood tree. Modeling and texturing of the NPC characters as well as
models for villagers and werewolves should begin. Graphics creation for
the HUD/UI should be mostly complete at this point. </li>
  <li>Months 6-8 - The modeling of the bridge and all the important
buildings in the town square (the magistrate's office and "The Den")
should be complete as well as the textures to go along with them. PC
and NPC character modeling should be completed. The models should now
be sent to the animators for rigging and animation. The texture artists
in addition to their architectural duties should continue working on
character textures. Mappers should have the city roughly laid out and
the town fairly well populated. </li>
  <li>Months 8-10 - All the buildings required for our little down are
now complete and the town's structure is also complete. The animators
have the meshes rigged provided to them by the animators and have basic
movements such as walking and running completely animated. </li>
  <li>Months 10-12 - All NPCs and PC meshes have been fully animated
and uv mapped. The mapping of town in Quark is complete and has been
populated with the inhabitants of the town. Switches are placed within
the game allowing players to open and clothes doors and provide other
interactivity that will be required in the game. NPC voices are
recorded for short phrases like "Good to see you again!" and "Come back
soon!".</li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="werewolfmilest">3) Werewolf Milestones</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>Milestone 001 - Finish design docs, complete concept art for 2-3
character, an architectural rendering, a 3d map of the village and
produce a snowballs type demo for recruiting purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<p>
<p><b>Misc. Bits which needs to be integrated</b>
<p>PvP Immunity for new players.  Your first player might have immunity for a month or something... then after that player reaches the month a bit is flipped...  Thereafter whenever a player starts a new character he/she gets an increasingly smaller immunity window.
Now a human who is in their werewolf form...  They can kill people and people can kill them.
<p>In the beginning when we're figuring out balance we need to limit PvP to players only being able to knock each other out with stipulations.  If there are two humans they can attack each other but they can not kill one another.  That goes for humans who are really werewolves but are in human form.  
<p>if a werewolf is killed in crions form - no vote is called for....if a werewolf is killed in human form (it's possible by another werewolf in crinos form) a vote will be called I guess
<p>Voting...  Players go to the town hall to sign a petition to vote for an execution.  Once a certain number of signatures have been procured then a vote is held to decide whom to  execute.  The votes are private but the players who signed and organized the petition are public knowledge.
<p>Flexible Event System - This is our flexible scripting system which will allow for rapid development of rules under which our world operates.  This includes players to a much lesser extent making their own rules (think A Tale In The Desert).  Players can make up their own laws, guild contests or even mini quiests if they so choose.
<p>Gambling - the players will be able to play simple games of chance in the wolf's den for food / money / whatever.
<p>Crafting - players will play simple but addictive mini-games in order to perform their crafting.  The difficulty of the game will be derived from how skilled the player is in a task and also how difficult the task is they're attempting.
