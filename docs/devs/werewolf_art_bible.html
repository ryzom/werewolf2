		This document is very rough and is constantly evolving. Check back later for further guidance.<br>
Also look at the <A href="http://www.ironicentertainment.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/werewolf/docs/devs/werewolf_design_doc.html?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/html">design 
document</A>.</P>

		Final pieces of concept art should be as realistic as possible. Artists 
should pay attention to the proportions etc. so as not to mislead 3D artists.<br>
It is recommended that an artist provide at least 3 different views of an object 
- front, side and back. And at least one of these should be colored to provide 
texture artists with the needed information. Important secondary items and markings 
may have to be drawn out separately to give a full overview.<br>
Other then that the artist can provide an arbitrary amout of images of the same 
object in a style of his/her choosing to best portray the &quot;mood&quot; of 
the object and to give 3D artists a good feel for it. For animateable things (especially 
characters) it would be good to see the characters in some extreme actions they 
might be in (maybe more detials on this later).</P> 
<P><H2><A name="modelling">III. Modelling</A></H2>
		Two kinds of meshes are accepted:
		
<DIV class="indent1"> <B>1)</B> A medium resolution (1500-2000k triangles per 
  character for example) mesh that can be simplified for lower polycounts or subdivided 
  for higher polycounts. It is recommended that the original of this mesh would 
  mostly be quads, because it is easier for humans to "read" and thus easier to 
  simplify. Also subdividing quads gives better results. </DIV>
		
<DIV class="indent1"> <B>2)</B> NURBS meshes - low and highpoly versions can be 
  derived directly from this.
  </DIV>
		The published meshes should always be triangles. Altho to make the life 
of texturers, riggers and animators easier - it should be left at quads until 
the final product.<br>
Characters should have separate eye and hair meshes - </P> that is, if there is 
a big hairy area it shoud have a swappable hair mesh. So model your characters 
bald.

<p>Need a standard here... bipeds, quadrupeds etc. The standards should/could 
  be derived off of each other...so maybe animations can be combined...like you 
  could have a quadruped walk animation and you can combine that with some wing 
  animation to apply it to say a dragon or pegasus. All that needs is probably 
  that the bone naming be the same for the bones they have in common.<br>
  Other then that...we need some ways to simplify and unify both the rigging and 
  animating process. One way is to use the shared weight maps - need a tool for 
  that. A general rigging system is probably impossible to create as people use 
  different applications - but we should try to go as far as possible, since this 
  is the basis for good animation :)<br>
  Riggers! Orient your local axes correctly! Do NOT make life miserable for animators! 
  Just to define what is &quot;correctly&quot; here goes: all joint placement 
  should be handled by the rotation of the parent joint coordinate system. The 
  x axis should run along the length of the bone and thus define it's direction. 
  Local translation should only be used for the root joint and for all other joints 
  restricted to the x axis. Also watch the orientation of those y and z axes - 
  make sure it makes sense for the current skeleton. Thank you! :)</p>

	Textures should be as close to photorealism as possible - if possible use 
photos as basis for the textures. Prelighting should be based on the features 
the model has present and keeping in mind that we might get nice bump mapping 
and all. Also high resolution meshes might want to use the same textures - so 
if possible keep the prelighting on separate layers on the original so it is possible 
to save the textures out both ways. Bump maps and displacement maps are welcome 
- the latter might be used as a modelling tool to crank up the detail on the medium 
resolution models. Original layered formats should also be submitted to cvs (or 
something like that) in the end - only the dimensions should be reduced to the 
final output size in order to reduce file size. These could also be compressed 
(rar, bzip, zip, tar etc.). Most published images should be in the DDS format 
if possible.  Source images should be stored as PSDs.</P>
