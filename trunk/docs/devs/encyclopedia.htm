<h1>The Encyclopedia </h1>
<p>This is a reference book or a history book where some crucial terms of the 
  world of Werewolf are explained. Many of the terms here are central to &quot;nordic 
  culture&quot; - explained are mostly those things that are important regarding 
  norsemen and their expansion. The Encyclopedia is connected to <a href="general_history_timeline.htm" target="general_timeline">General 
  History Timeline</a></p>
<p>This is not something players will ever see. This document is purely for developers. 
  Knowing the history will help us create better content, not all things are for 
  players to know though. It is the secret of storytelling - some things are better 
  only hinted and not fully revealed, it makes the experience all the more interesting, 
  more mysterious. We would like it if legends, tales, rumours and stories like 
  that were born, created by players. And we would like to provide future surprises. 
  That is how i feel and i'm sure others agree.</p>
<p>One should also keep in mind that the names of kings and other characters are 
  not set in stone - i just had to name them somehow. The same goes for the names 
  of races etc. </p>

<h2>Ancient Races <a name="ancientraces"></a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ancient races are the ones we would call pre-human perhaps. Some of them 
  are powerful beings who could play &quot;gods&quot; or things like that. All 
  ancient superior races have their own <span class="char_name">innate magic</span>. 
  Vargfolk is one of those races. Dragons too. Most of them are dead or long gone 
  from this planet now though. Some were killed by vargfolk. There were about 
  7-8 allied superior races at the time when the vargfolk was imprisoned. But 
  there were only 2 members from the 8th race and they sacrificed their lives 
  to create <a href="#guardians">guardians</a> for the valley of vargfolk, today 
  known as Laurelin. <span class="comment">The number of ancient races is actually 
  not that certain - we make them up as we need them, so 7-8 races is not really 
  accurate. Also, not all ancient races are superior ones. Vargfolk was definetly 
  a superior race. Dragons probably too somewhat. Since the superior races are 
  those most relevant to the human history, they are the ones we speak about mostly. 
  So, in this document mostly ancient race = superior race. </span></p>
<p>Vargfolk didn't pose as gods, but there were those superior races that did. 
  Some of them differentiate between good and bad, some might even have spawned 
  the whole good and bad thing. <span class="comment">There is one superior we 
  have discussed, who definetely posed as god or at least willingly gave humans 
  magical abilities. We call her the Goddess of Fertility or Mother Earth for 
  now. Herbalist magic is probably her doing.</span></p>
<p>At the moment 2 of the ancient races have been given more thought:</p>
<h3>Vargfolk <a name="vargfolk"></a></h3>
<p>One of the ancient races. They are totally extinct now. However, as a last 
  resort to save their race, they imprisoned themselves into <a href="#">orichalculum</a>, 
  so there is a chance that they might return. Meaning, that their physical form 
  might be extinct, but their spiritual presence is still there, inside the orichalculum. 
  As long as there is even a single piece of orichalculum, vargfolk is not completely 
  gone from this world. <span class="comment">So, that is the reason i speak of 
  vargfolk as if they still existed in this world. Depending on the decisions 
  players make vargfolk might return in their physical form too.</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="char_name">Physical appearance:</span><span class="comment"> </span><br>
  Werewolf/horehound is their natural form - <span class="char_name">humanoid 
  race with wolfish appereance</span> <a name="wolfform"></a>. Their height = 
  3 meters normal, 4 meters in very rare cases. They are very strong physically. 
  Very fast. And almost immortal - they are extremely difficult to kill, although 
  they can be slain (but never by <a href="#humans">humans</a>).</p>
<p><span class="char_name">Magic: </span><br>
  They are born with innate magical abilities which they are able to develop to 
  become extremely powerful in magic. Vargfolk are purely magical - connected 
  directly to their own source of magic. They also have telepathy within their 
  own racial bounds. They also have telekinetic abilities etc. And shapeshifting 
  abilities, but they prefer their natural form which they are very proud of . 
  They were extremly powerful battlemages - in large battles of thousands of humans 
  would have been the sparse back row, even having one of the vargfolk battlemages 
  would have made the battle won already. Their magic is what we would call <a href="#divinemagic">divine 
  magic</a>, magic of elements. </p>
<p><span class="char_name">Age, population:</span><br>
  Lifetime of a single creature = 500 000 years. <br>
  Like other ancient races, they are practically immortal, so they don't breed 
  much.<br>
  They had quite a stable population for at least as long as humans have existed. 
  So we could say, that there were ~1000 members of vargfolk around at the time 
  of humans.<br>
  And they have existed for billions of years.</p>
<p><span class="char_name">Location: </span><br>
  We don't know about before, but at the time of humans they already dwelled in 
  a closed valley on an island. They created this valley with their magic - taking 
  mountains (which were probably in a row or the shape of semicircle) and pulling 
  them together, creating thus a full circle. This magically created valley surrounded 
  by high mountains was their stronghold. This valley is now known as <a href="#laurelin">Laurelin 
  Valley</a>. Vargfolk had a gate at where the river goes through the mountains 
  now, but when their civilisation crumbled, the gate was destroyed and a river 
  started to flow through the opening thus created. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="char_name">Personality and other races:</span> <br>
  They are highly intelligent. They have extreme racial pride and honor. They 
  likely have no sense of good and evil, they just don't care about anyone except 
  their own kin and in that sense they are brutal. They have <span class="char_name">no 
  bloodlust</span> <a name="bloodlust"></a>, no need to kill, but they don't not 
  care for the rest of the world much. So basically they are arrogant &quot;bastards&quot;. 
  They value their privacy - so anyone entering Laurelin valley without their 
  permission was killed. Humans are basically like flies to them. They might even 
  kill because someone is blocking the road (not one of their own race of course). 
  They are a lot wiser than any human could ever hope to be. Thus they are likely 
  beyond material things and emotions such as greed etc. Vargfolk doesn't hate 
  humans, they just don't care for creatures with a so short life span. </p>
<p>Most of the other ancient superior races were gone by the time of humans, some 
  had left this planet, others killed or imprisoned by vargfolk. Vargfolk waged 
  war with other ancient races because they wanted to rule all, or not rule actually, 
  they just wanted to be the only real power around. They did not pose as gods 
  to lesser races. They just wanted to become all powerful and the others were 
  in their way - especially those pesky &quot;gods&quot; who thought that &quot;it 
  would upset the balance of the world&quot;.</p>
<p>They probably got bored in their valley, since they had wiped out most of the 
  other superior races who opposed them. And i suppose they like intrigue. So, 
  creating <a href="#seers">seers </a>was likely a fun experiment for one of the 
  vargfolk or something. They never got involved in human things on their own 
  initiative. They did not care why humans wanted to kill each other. But if some 
  humans came begging for their help and that was in line with their own goals 
  and might have been amusing - they did it... and might even have killed the 
  very people they helped after that. No human has ever managed to killed one 
  of the vargfolk, humans are just annoying to those superior beings. Not even 
  an army of humans could beat one of the vargfolk. </p>
<p>Vargfolk is also quite secretive. They did not want any of their secrects and 
  creations to fall into the hands of the other races, especially their long time 
  enemies. </p>
<p><span class="char_name">Interracial hierarchy:</span><br>
  Vargfolk has great sense of racial unity - likely thanks to telepathy, high 
  intelligence, long existance (both racial, which is about billions of years, 
  and individual), small population and strong hierarchy. So, no murders within 
  the race - good relations with other members. We have discussed that they either 
  have a strong hierarchy (respecting the elders etc) or a single collective mind. 
  Vargfolk might be humanoid/bipedal in appearance, but their minds are very different 
  from anything humans could imagine. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="char_name">Players: </span><br>
  The question is - will the players ever learn about the vargfolk? What do the 
  humans in this world know about vargfolk? At the moment humans don't know anything 
  about them. At the time vargfolk still roamed this world, humans knew about 
  their existence of course. They knew that they killed humans, helped some humans 
  kill other humans, made deals with gods, killed dragons and other mystical beasts 
  - things like that perhaps. Humans thought of vargfolk as a bloodthirsty race 
  of titans/giants or something similar. Demons - like <span class="char_name"><a href="#">dragons</a> 
  </span>. Some might have formed cults to worship vargfolk (seers for example). 
  It must be retained, that vargfolk never imposed themselves as gods. And norsemen 
  mostly knew what seers chose to tell them. So, the cult was probably more in 
  the interest of seers. Anyway, all this is forgotten by now. It was forgotten 
  long long ago. <span class="comment">There could probably be a statue of one 
  of vargfolk somewhere - so by finding it more rumours evolve. A weathered statue 
  could be found on some mountain side or some ruins...things like that. So, in 
  Laurelin valley some revelations will be made. But what kind revelations, that 
  needs to be discussed still. </span></p>
<h3>Dragons <a name="dragons"></a></h3>
<p>One of the ancient races. They can't likely speak in any understandable (oral) 
  language. They have interracial telepathy, some might even be able to mind-talk 
  with other superior races (the inferior races, like humans, don't count anyway). 
  They are likely anatomically unable to produce advanced oral speech and consider 
  it an inferior means of communication. The intelligence of remaining dragons 
  is quite low compared to other superior races. This might be the result of experiments 
  vargfolk made with them - vargfolk's aim wasn't to increase the intelligence 
  of dragonfolk, they just wanted obedient and strong riding beasts. The imprisoned 
  dragons - the dragonlords - have likely higher intelligence though, especially 
  the queen. The deterioration of inferior dragons (the ones that are free) is 
  likely due to the long imprisonment of their leaders.</p>
<p>Dragons breed more than any other superior race, are still quite selective 
  about their mates. One could say that they are not so much interested in cultivating 
  their intelligence as some other characteristics - strength being one of them 
  i'm sure. Even if their queen is able to produce 10 offsprings one year, only 
  one will probably survive since dragons kill the weaker ones of their race. 
  ( It is clear that now there is only one, the queen, but before there were probably 
  more females)</p>
<p>Dragons are mostly just very big and strong predators. <span class="comment">They 
  are extremely huge, humans would probably be the size of a grown dragons' toe-nails 
  and their roar would really deafen an army. Note that this is a poetical comparison 
  or something like that and the the exact measurements have not been decided 
  yet.</span><br>
  <br>
  They evolved from the great sea serpents. Visually they are like wurms/serpents 
  with wings and less like &quot;dogs with wings&quot;. Magic is innate to them 
  - like some defence mechanism they use when they are in danger or something 
  similar (breathing fire might be one of those magic skills). <br>
  <br>
  Dragonfolk was enslaved by <a href="#vargfolk">vargfolk</a>- they were like 
  trained dogs or horses to the mighty members of the vargfolk. There are few 
  dragons still left - more than can be said about most of the ancient races. 
  Vargfolk killed most of them though. And imprisoned the the mightiest ones - 
  they didn't have heart to kill the mightier dragon lords, they hoped to force 
  their &quot;pets&quot; into slavery again. Those bonds are still there. Amongst 
  those very few that were imprisoned is also the queen of the dragonfolk, so 
  those dragons who are free cannot breed. Only a few dragons are left, you could 
  basically count them &quot;on your fingers&quot;. And those who are free are 
  not the mighty ones, they are the inferior ones. They live on some islands off 
  the coast of the continent where Gormsby is (the northern continent). And a 
  few more of them dwell in various mountains all over the lands. There are max 
  ~15 dragons left perhaps, ~5 of which are imprisoned. Dragons are myths in most 
  parts of the world. But there are those places where they are sighted over 20-50 
  years or so and those are the parts where new stories about them are born.</p>
<h2>Catastrophes<a name="catastrophes"></a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Demise Of The Vargfolk<a name="demise_of_the_vargfolk"></a></h3>
<p>~10 000 BT<br>
  As the last hope for survival <a href="#vargfolk">vargfolk</a> imprison themselves 
  in <a href="#">orichalculum</a>. The union of other remaining ancient races 
  puts <span class="char_name"><a href="#guardians">guardian spirits</a></span> 
  in the valley where vargfolk dwelled so that not a piece of orichalculum would 
  &quot;get out&quot; of there. This is the valley which will be known as the 
  <span class="char_name"> <a href="#laurelin">"forbidden valley" - Laurelin</a></span> 
  village will be there. <br>
</p>
<h3>Cold Death<a name="cold_death"></a></h3>
~990 BT <br>
A great plague comes from south during one winter &amp; kills many people in the 
lands of norsemen. 
<h3>The Great Flood<a name="great_flood"></a></h3>
<p>~800 BT <br>
  A region in the south (size of Germany) is being flooded. A large &amp; important 
  trading town is completely destroyed. Ruins, treasure etc can still be found 
  in that area.</p>
<h2>Guardian Spirits <a name="guardians"></a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are entities that the 8<span class="char_name"> <a href="#ancientraces">ancient 
  races</a></span> created in order to prevent <span class="char_name"><a href="#">orichalculum</a></span> 
  leaving the <span class="char_name">&quot;forbidden valley&quot; </span>aka<span class="char_name"> 
  </span><a href="#laurelin">Laurelin valley</a> - they didn't want <a href="#vargfolk">vargfolk</a> 
  to find a way back to this world, they wanted vargfolk to stay imprisoned forever. 
  2 remaining members of the 8th race sacrificed their lives in order to create 
  the guardians, so now only 7 of these races are left. </p>
<p>The spirits are not evil, they are just protective. Or rather, they don't have 
  very warm feelings towards humans and they hate vargfolk. Humans try to get 
  orichalculum out of the valley, they already did - that is the reason for loathing 
  humans. The guardian spirits are not evil, but they &quot;seem&quot; evil from 
  the point of view of humans because the spirits attack the people who have orichalculum. 
  So <span class="char_name"><a href="#curse1">curse nr. 1</a> </span>~1253 BT 
  marks the time when the guardian spirits get angry at humans, mainly because 
  the old mage created Silverfang, a pure orichalculum weapon. Spirits also hate 
  <a href="#">werewolves</a> and <a href="#seers">seers</a> - those abominations. 
</p>
<p>The guardians are seen rarely though - they dispatch minions and guard the 
  outer most areas. Everyone who ventures too far will be killed. How far is too 
  far depends on how strong you are. <span class="comment">Guardian spirits are 
  also a way of controlling the size of the map.</span></p>
<p>The guardian spirits can be killed though, but it's very hard.</p>
<h2>Expansion of Norsemen <a name="expansion_of_norsemen"></a></h2>
<p>The Expansion of Norsemen is a long and important era in the history of <a href="#norsemen">norsemen</a>, 
  which lasts <span class="char_name">~2900 - 1250 BT </span>generally, in case 
  we include Wave Zero. This all takes place in time that norsemen were still 
  a clan based community. So the expansion was not so much an effort of a unified 
  nation, especially not during Wave Zero. During the later waves there probably 
  was some kind of co-operation between the clans, particularily starting from 
  the <span class="char_name">Second Wave</span> - due to the war they had with 
  <a href="#chinese">chinese</a>. Basically, they norsemen were somewhat unified 
  because they so to say &quot;met their match&quot; and realized that having 
  some kind of collaboration between the clans might not be such a bad idea. This 
  does not mean that all the clans worked together all the time during the Second 
  and Third Wave aka The Golden Age of Expansion, it means that the larger ones 
  probably did join their forces in some cases. <span class="char_name"><a href="#longwar">The 
  Long War</a></span> could definitely be seen as a joint effort in some sense, 
  but there was a lot of relatively independent acitivity even during that war 
  - the coastal raids. Those raids weakened the enemy, but nevertheless were largely 
  driven by desire to get more fame and fortune for the clan.</p>
<p class="char_desc">Also note, that to understand the expansion you should look 
  at 2 maps:</p>
<h3 class="char_name">Expansion Map <a name="expansion_map"></a></h3>
<p class="char_name"><a href="../../media/concept-artwork/maps/world/worldmap_expansion_web_1200.jpg" target="fullExpansionMap"><img src="../../media/concept-artwork/maps/world/worldmap_expansion_web.jpg" alt="click for a larger version" width="800" height="400" border="0"></a></p>
<p class="char_desc">This map shows the waves of expansion. The placement of islands 
  and continents may be in change at the moment, but the map should give a general 
  idea nonetheless. I usually won't hyperlink here, but one should keep this map 
  open when reading about the expansion.</p>

  comes out of isolation and outside world rediscovers the existance of <span class="char_name"><a href="#orichalculum">orichalculum</a></span>. 
  One of the nordic clans starts mining there. This also leads to rediscovering 
  <span class="char_name"><a href="#ulfhedin">ulfhedin</a></span>. Near the end 
  of this period, ~2415 BT twenty norseman ships sail further E for exploring 
  purposes. Very far E they meet 4 huge <a href="#chineseships">chinese ships</a> 
  . 12 norseman ships survive the battle which at the moment is known in our history 
  as <span class="char_name">Sea-Battle In The Far-Eastern Waters With The Fire-Breathing 
  Giant-Ships <a name="seabattlewithchinese1"></a></span>. <span class="comment">A 
  shorter name for this battle would be needed at some point i guess.</span> One 
  chinese ship follows norsemen to home waters and is defeated there, but manages 
  to send a messanger-bird to &quot;chinese homeland&quot; first. </p>
<h3>War With the &quot;Chinese&quot;<a name="war_with_the_chinese"></a></h3>
<p>This sea-battle and its consequences bring an abrupt end to the First Wave 
  of Expansion, since ~2400 - 2395 BT an <span class="char_name">invasion by the 
  <a href="#chinese">chinese</a></span> takes place. Norsemen call them The Sea-Beast 
  Lords. &quot;Chinese fleet&quot; comes to explore and take revenge. All norsemen 
  clans unite to defeat this enemy - <span class="char_name">largest <a href="#ting">ting</a></span> 
  ever is held to decide this. War goes mainly on in the coastal waters and coastal 
  regions. Nobody is losing or winning. &quot;Chinese&quot; just suddenly end 
  the war by sailing away (possibly because they were called back and didn't find 
  much interesting in these lands etc).</p>
<h3>Second Wave <a name="second_wave"></a></h3>
<p>~2200 - 2100 BT<br>
  More of the <a href="#regions_places_map">southern continent</a> is conquered. 
  Celts expand SW.</p>
<h3>The Long War<a name="the_long_war"></a></h3>
<p>~2100 - 1600 BT<br>
  A tremendously long war takes place between norsemen and the natives who live 
  on Southern Contient over the pass or neck of land, which unites that part of 
  Southern Continent which is under norsemen control (<a href="#regions_places_map">4 
  on the map</a>) with the rest of the Southern Continent. The war finally ends 
  with the <span class="char_name">victory of norsemen</span> and the establishing 
  of a large warcamp, which will later evolve into a large city called <a href="#thorsby">Thorsby</a>. 
  <span class="comment">This is a temporary name until something better comes 
  to mind. </span></p>
<h3>Golden Age aka Third Wave <a name="goldenage"></a></h3>
<p>~1550 - 1250 BT<br>
  Norsemen expand even further <a href="#regions_places_map">S</a> (5 on the map) 
  now that they have a good outpost so far south.<br>
  ~1280 BT <span class="char_name"><a href="#silverfang_temp">Silverfang</a></span> 
  is forged by a hermit mage. <br>
  ~1253 BT <a href="#curse1">Curse Nr.1</a> in the village of Laurelin.<br>
  ~1250 BT norsemen are beaten by some <span class="char_name"><a href="#farsouthernfolk">far-southern 
  folk</a></span>. Look for <a href="#regions_places_map">location</a> we have 
  in mind. A group of norsemen is killed or taken prisoner there (prisoners killed 
  later). This probably angers the norsemen at first, but at the same time they 
  feel respect towards this nation. Opposition with these far-southerners (who 
  might worship dragons or some other ancient race) is one of the reasons beside 
  the curse that puts an end to further expansion S. After some time some norsemen 
  start serving as mercenaries/guards for the leaders of that land. Some of these 
  mercenary-chiefs are given land. Today these &quot;norsemen&quot; speak a different 
  language &amp; have different customs - they still feel some kinship to the 
  real norsemen, but at the same time don't hesitate to fight against them too.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Humans <a name="humans"></a></h2>
<p class="comment">It should be noted that all the names in this section are to 
  be taken as placeholders. Also, the celtic, nordic and chinese culture no doubt 
  provided and will provide us with some inspiration, but those names will change. 
  And so will the nature of our civilisations. We are not copying those Real Life 
  civilisations - we merely use the aspects we like to create our own. Norsemen 
  is being used at the moment because their homeland is N and has similar conditions 
  to Norway. Norsemen also value battle greatly etc. The fact that some aspects 
  of our nordic culture - mentality, long-houses, long-boats etc - may be similar 
  to the one of viking age, doesn't however free us from the obligation to create 
  a totally new and original religion for them for example. Celts is being used 
  because they probably have red hair and tattoos and they are good archers and 
  horsemen etc. Chinese because they live at the other end of the world and chinese 
  culture in real world is and was very alien to viking culture - this is one 
  opposition we would like to emphasize. Also, the chinese ships in WW are somewhat 
  inspired by The Great Fleet. </p>
<h3>Celts <a name="celts"></a></h3>
<p>A placeholder name for people that live on <a href="#regions_places_map">Western 
  Islands</a>. Norsemen meet this fierce and proud folk ~2770 BT. An alliance 
  is formed between norsemen and the &quot;celts&quot;. The latter become the 
  greatest bloodbrothers to the norsemen, after some centuries they are practically 
  known as the same nation. It could be said that that which was once one nation, 
  became one once again. Or at least their roots are the same - the ancestors 
  of the &quot;celts&quot; probably fought in the seers' army ~10 00 - 9800 BT 
  too. During <a href="#timeofthekings">The Time of Kings</a> celtic area is to 
  be known as <a href="#westernkingdom">Western Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p> &quot;Celtic&quot; influences to nordic culture:<br>
  <span class="char_name">Money</span> (metal pieces and jewels). It is the weight 
  of the metal pieces or jewels that is important though. And bartering still 
  remains too. <br>
  <span class="char_name">Horses</span> (big, Shire-like warhorses i think) <br>
  <span class="char_name"><a href="#shieldmaiden">Shieldmaidens</a></span> aka 
  extremely powerful female warriors <br>
  <span class="char_name">Archery </span> <br>
  <span class="char_name"><a href="#roundhouses">Round-houses </a> </span>(used 
  in that part of the lands later too) <br>
  Some <span class="char_name">changes in the writing</span> probably <br>
</p>
<h3> Chinese <a name="chinese"></a></h3>
<p>A placeholder name for a human race that lives very far away from the region 
  where norsemen live and travel. So far the ways of chinese and norsemen have 
  only crossed once. During the First Wave of Expansion, ~2415 BT some norsemen 
  sail far east from their home continent and battle with huge &quot;fire-breathing&quot; 
  ships. 15 years later the enemy comes to take revenge and explore the home waters 
  of the norsemen. There is a short (~2400 - 2395 BT) but hard war between chinese 
  and norsemen. War goes mainly on in the coastal waters and coastal regions of 
  the lands under norsemen control. Nobody is losing or winning. &quot;Chinese&quot; 
  just suddenly end the war by sailing away (possibly because they were called 
  back and didn't find much interesting in these lands etc). <span class="comment">For 
  chinese location look at the <a href="#expansion_map">expansion map</a>.</span></p>
<h3><br>
  Far-Southern Folk <a name="farsouthernfolk"></a></h3>
<p>A descriptive name for a nation that lives <a href="#regions_places_map">far 
  south</a> on the larger part of the Southern Contient. A group of norsemen is 
  killed or taken prisoner by them (prisoners likely killed later) ~1250 BT. This 
  probably angers the norsemen at first, but at the same time they feel respect 
  towards this nation. Opposition with these far-southerners (who might worship 
  dragons or some other ancient race) is one of the reasons beside the curse that 
  puts an end to further expansion S. After some time some norsemen start serving 
  as mercenaries/guards for the leaders of that land. Some of these mercenary-chiefs 
  are given land. Today these &quot;norsemen&quot; speak a different language 
  and have different customs - they still feel some kinship to the real norsemen 
  but don't hesitate to fight against them too. <span class="comment">Btw, the 
  far-southerners and southerners are not the same nation. When speaking about 
  southerners i mean the inhabitants of Southern Continent that are conquered 
  by norsemen. I will not list them here separately because i haven't given them 
  any thought and in the end they will be under the rule of norsemen anyway. This 
  is the same reason i will not list the easterners (the ones who live on that 
  huge islands east of Northern Continent) separately. The far-southerners are 
  as special case though.</span></p>
<h3>Norsemen <a name="norsemen"></a></h3>
<p> A placeholder name for a nation whose homeland is on the <a href="#regions_places_map">Northern 
  Continent</a>. Their ancestors served in the vast armies of <span class="char_name"><a href="#seers">seers</a></span> 
  ~10 000 - 9800 BT, fighting against <a href="#dragons">dragons</a>. Those armies 
  were defeated however and scattered all over the world. ~6000 BT comes an end 
  to their nomadic lifestyle however - future <a href="#gormthewanderer">Gormsby</a> 
  is founded and new homeland found. This rocky land, growing to about the size 
  of Norway (~300 000 square km) will later be known as the homeland of norsemen. 
  The first settlement will later grow into the city of Gormsby. Apart from being 
  blessed by ancestors this land provides good hiding places for the raiding norsemen. 
  Dominant architecture at that time are long-houses. By this time the seers &amp; 
  vargfolk are long forgotten.</p>
<p>Norsemen society is a <span class="char_name">clan</span> <a name="clan"></a> 
  based society until <a href="#timeofthekings">The Time of Kings</a>. And even 
  then there are <span class="char_name"><a href="#rebels">traditionalists, rebels</a></span> 
  and today the society is clan based once again. Nordic clan is named after the 
  leader of the clan - when the clan leader changes, so does the name of the clan. 
  The position of the clan leader is not hereditary, it rather follow the rule 
  that &quot;the strongest and wisest man rules&quot;. This man can be of course 
  the descendant of the previous leader, but he has no privilege before his clansmen. 
  The position of the new clanleader will likely be decided during a gathering, 
  <span class="char_name">a ting <a name="ting"></a></span>. </p>
<p> Norsemen value <span class="char_name">battle, glory, honor</span> etc. However, 
  they are not a culture trained for large battles, for war - they are a culture 
  trained to raid (by the seers). They are not trained for naval battles either. 
  They sneak up on the enemy, hit fast, loot fast and run away fast - this is 
  called <span class="char_name">raiding</span>. Their <span class="char_name"><a href="#longships">long-ships</a></span> 
  are specially built for this purpose. Their ancestors were elite troops or trained 
  for special assignments, not some meatshields to be sacrificed in the first 
  line of defense in the battles. Norsemen think that to die is good if you have 
  killed many enemies and it is good to die in the battle and not pass away in 
  the battle, not while figthing is disgraceful. They surely think they are chosen 
  by some god or gods and that after their death they will go to some place like 
  Valhalla. <span class="comment">We are calling the place warriors go when they 
  die Valhalla or draw the parallel with Valhalla, because we don't have a better 
  name for it yet and because in religion there is surely some kind afterlife. 
  We haven't however given much thought to their religion and beliefs yet, but 
  our afterlife vision will probably be somewhat different from Valhalla. </span></p>
<p>During the <span class="char_name">The Time of Clans </span>(the pre-kings-period) 
  women will likely never rule because rulership is not passed on to kin - it 
  is taken by the strongest. Women would still hold power as they are left to 
  take care of the fields and children and do the fishing while the men are out 
  raiding. So, economically women are the more powerful force in clan-based society. 
  Men are the military force though. And in <span class="char_name">the tings</span> 
  - gatherings of one clan or many clans - man's word is likely still better than 
  woman's. Women belong to the clan of their birth even after the marriage. A 
  woman can divorce and go back to her birth-family. Her offsprings belong to 
  their father's clan however. </p>
<h4>Gorm the Wanderer <a name="gormthewanderer"></a></h4>
<p><span class="char_name">The Greatest Clanleader of Norsemen</span>, the ancestor 
  of norsemen.<br>
  Lived ~6000 BT.<br>
  Gorm the Wanderer and his clan settle on a land north where Gorm finds a <span class="char_name">&quot;magical 
  sword&quot;</span>. <span class="char_name">The sword probably belonged to an 
  <a href="#ulfhedin">ulfhedin</a> once and is made of pure <a href="#orichalculum">orichalculum</a>. 
  It is the elder brethern of <a href="#silverfang_temp">Silverfang</a>.</span> 
  This sword will be lost again later for future generations to find, it is probably 
  trapped somewhere in the north, under an iceberg since i had this idea that 
  Gorm went there to fight the ice dragon. This trip probably took place because 
  the sword wanted to get into the hands of some superior. This rocky land, growing 
  to about the size of Norway (~300 000 square km) will later be known as the 
  homeland of norsemen. The first settlement will later grow into the city of 
  Gormsby. Apart from being blessed by ancestors this land provides good hiding 
  places for the raiding norsemen. Dominant architecture at that time are long-houses. 
  By this time the seers and vargfolk are long forgotten. </p>
<p class="comment">Oh, and Gorm the Wanderer is here only because we don't have 
  a separate section for clans and clanleaders yet.</p>
<p class="comment">&nbsp;</p>
<p>~500 BT begins <span class="char_name"><a href="#timeofthekings">The Time of 
  Kings</a> </span>and during that age leadership becomes hereditary. There are 
  quite a few queens too.</p>
<h2>Magic<a name="magic"></a></h2>
<p>Magic is very rare in our world, but it has the potential to be very powerful.<br>
  Basically, at the moment (until <a href="#laurelin">Laurelin</a> valley is opened) 
  we have 2 kinds of magic users:</p>
<h3>Seers <a name="seers"></a></h3>
<p>Seers are the ones, who kind of worshipped <span class="char_name"><a href="#vargfolk">vargfolk</a></span> 
  (and were tolerated by them) and hence they maintain a fraction (very deformed 
  one) of the magic vargfolk used - they were either given these powers or got 
  it by being exposed to the magic aura of vargfolk, this isn't quite decided 
  yet. But the magic is certainly in their blood - it is inherited. So, seers 
  form <span class="char_name">bloodlines </span>(which have forgotten their roots 
  by now or even long before today or <a href="#timeofthekings">The Time of Kings</a> 
  or even before <a href="#gormthewanderer">The Time of Gorm</a>). </p>
<p>Seers use kind of <span class="char_name">divine</span> or <span class="char_name">elemental 
  magic <a name="divinemagic"></a></span>. Thanks to vargfolk, they have the abilities 
  of <span class="char_name">foresight </span><span class="comment">(actually 
  in this case it is connected to werewolves)</span><span class="char_name">, 
  control of light (teleportation etc), telekinesis, force field </span>and <span class="char_name">lightning</span> 
  in higher levels. They also have the gift of <span class="char_name">healing</span> 
  in higher levels. It's a very high level seer ability and their heal can probably 
  even raise dead given enough energy. It is also likely that it's an area of 
  effect spell. To become a high level seer is extremely difficult, so only few 
  such people (the battle-seers) are known in the history. Others have kept their 
  identity hidden. </p>
<p>Seers manipulated the ancestors of norsemen for their own purposes and told 
  them that vargfolk are gods and they - embassadors of the gods.</p>
<p>~10 00 - 9800 BT seers were scattered all over the world, hiding from dragons. 
</p>
<p>Seers do not belong among any separate nations (and <a href="#ulfhedin">ulfhedins</a> 
  as their followers neither). If vargfolk should be destroyed (especially <a href="#silverfang_temp">Silverfang</a> 
  and/or <a href="#gormthewanderer">Sword of Gorm</a> as items that possess a 
  whole vargfolk spirit), seers will slowly lose their powers and no new ones 
  will evolve. No new ulfhedins and <a href="#werewolf">werewolves</a> will come 
  into being too. </p>
<h3>Herbalists <a name="herbalism"></a></h3>
<p>Herbalism is a totally differant kind of magic. It's origins are unknown at 
  the moment - might have been &quot;the gift&quot; of some superior race. But 
  considering the idea that every <a href="#ancientraces">ancient race</a> has 
  its own magic source and that the magic and the source is different for each 
  of the ancients, herbalism too was probably granted to humans by one of the 
  superior races. <span class="comment">We have given some thought to something 
  like Mother Earth aka Gaea, a fertility goddess. </span>Herbalists are able 
  to make <span class="char_name">potions</span> etc, have the ability to <span class="char_name">heal</span>, 
  <span class="char_name">shapeshift</span>, <span class="char_name">control animals</span> 
  and do some spells like <span class="char_name">entangle, blind, fog etc </span> 
  perhaps. Herbalists are more like shamans. They too don't belong among any separate 
  race.</p>
<p class="comment">Note that as many other things, magical abilities and the use 
  of them has not been completely decided on yet. The skill system needs to be 
  worked out before. But this section should give some overview of what we have 
  in mind.</p>
<h2>Norse Architecture<a name="norse_architecture"></a></h2>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Cave-Forts <a name="caveforts"></a></h3>
<p>Cave-forts are established ~4000 BT by norsemen. There are about 4-5 strongholds 
  in the natural cave-systems on the western shore of the Northern Continent where 
  there are a lot of fjords. Norsemen don't modify the caves, some clans just 
  use them as outposts for raiding parties. These cave-forts are well hidden &amp; 
  not easy to access - there are a lot of islands in these fjords &amp; some of 
  these islands are under water. During the <a href="#expansion_map">expansion</a>, 
  probably after the <span class="char_name"><a href="#chinese">chinese</a></span> 
  invasion ~2395-2200 BT the cave-forts are modified though to make them even 
  harder to access and more comfortable to live in.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Long-Houses <a name="longhouses"></a></h3>
<p>Those are the houses most characteristic to <span class="char_name"><a href="#norsemen">norsemen</a></span> 
  and their <span class="char_name">clan</span> based society. They were most 
  common when the whole family used to live together in one house etc.</p>
<p>Reference:</p>
<p><a href="http://werewolf.game-host.org/~elo/Reference/Architecture/long-houses/" target="long_houses">some 
  pictures</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Log-Huts <a name="loghouses"></a></h3>
<p>Are incorporated into nordic architecture ~2900 BT, when norsemen invaded the 
  <span class="char_name"><a href="#regions_places_map">Southern Contienent</a>.</span> 
  The conquered nation lives in log-houses. Some norsemen build similar buildings, 
  but long-houses still dominate as living houses. Log-houses are being built 
  more when the sons want their own separate house etc. Could happen during the 
  rest of the expansion already, but was especially popular during <a href="#timeofthekings">The 
  Time of Kings</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the reference here shows quite simple loghouses, they would get more 
  complicated in time however.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Round-Houses <a name="roundhouses"></a></h3>
<p>This is being <span class="char_name"><a href="#celts">celtic</a></span> influence 
  and is more popular in western region. So, ~2770 BT is the date since when this 
  architecture will start to have any influence on nordic culture. </p>

<h3>Stave Houses <a name="stavehouses"></a></h3>
<p><span class="char_name">The Great House</span> built around ~480 BT by <a href="#ulfthegrey">Ulf 
  the Grey</a> is the first of this style. This house is similar in style to the 
  stabkirche/stave churches. It has a high ceiling &amp; staves, columns inside 
  &amp; outside of the house, double wall, many roofs on different levels, rich 
  ornamentation. Many houses of similar style will be built by kings later - some 
  also make some parts of the house circular in shape (in western kingdoms later). 
  Since the wood gets a special treatment these houses can remain somewhat intact 
  up to 900 years, provided they are taken good care of. Basically, those houses 
  are huge like long-houses, built of wood and incorporate both square and round 
  shapes etc.</p>

<h2>Norse Burial Traditions<a name="norse_burial_traditions"></a></h2>
<p>There are 2 kinds of nordic burials:</p>
<h3>Ship-Burnings <a name="shipsburnings"></a></h3>
<p>Burning the deceased is the old way, the way of the clans, traditionalists. 
  <span class="comment">Think of 13th Warrior for example.</span> Burning seems 
  more divine to clansmen than digging the body into earth and letting it rot. 
  They burn the body in ship or boat. </p>
<h3>Stone-barrows <a name="stonebarrows"></a></h3>
<p>~415 BT the trader-king of a eastern kingdom <a href="#gjukieiligsson">Gjuki 
  Eiligsson</a> starts a new burial tradition. Soon other kingdoms follow the 
  tradition, only the &quot;rebels&quot; stick to the old ship-burnings. Today 
  those 2 burial ways exist side by side. </p>
<p><a href="http://werewolf.game-host.org/%7Eelo/Reference/Barrows/" target="barrows">Look 
  here for some reference.</a></p>
<h2>Norse Cities and Villages<a name="norse_cities_and_villages"></a></h2>
<h3>Gormsby <a name="gormsby"></a></h3>
<p>The capital of Norsemen. For more info see <a href="#norsemen">here</a></p>
<h3>Laurelin <a name="laurelin"></a></h3>
<p>Laurelin as a valley on a small island somewhere among <a href="#regions_places_map">Western 
  Islands</a> has played an important role in our history. Once it was the stronghold 
  of <a href="#vargfolk">vargfolk</a>, who probably killed anyone who entered 
  the valley without permission..Thus that would make the valley off limits by 
  tradition and legend. But despite the old fears and all kinds of terrible rumours 
  it was inhabited once again by... humans, a little fraction of <a href="#norsemen">norsemen</a>. 
  And so a village by the name of Laurelin was founded ~2790-2770 BT. During the 
  <span class="char_name">Expansion</span> (~2500-1553 BT), especially the <span class="char_name"><a href="#goldenage">Golden 
  Age</a></span> it was a military outpost with few settlements - norsemen from 
  mainland mined orichalculum there and forged weapons in a special &quot;smithy&quot;, 
  a fort that was built on the island. So, the population of Laurelin at that 
  time consisted mostly of villagers, miners, military people and those who made 
  the weapons (smiths and mages). Perhaps there were a few mage towers too. No 
  big cities though. Since Laurelin was a rather peaceful place and with good 
  natural resources crafting skills had evolved to a very high level there.</p>
<p>After Laurelin came out of isolation (~2500 BT), it was managed only by one 
  clan probably, it was common property of the norsemen and was given to one clan 
  to protect/manage. So outside Laurelin valley there were max 700 people on the 
  island - if it was a big clan. At that time Laurelin was quite prosperous. <span class="comment">The 
  present island population will be determined by how many ppl the server can 
  hold after/during the expansion (the game expansion, not the history one).</span> 
</p>
<p>Great misery has fallen upon Laurelin due to the orichalculum though : </p>
<p><span class="char_name">Curse nr. 1</span> <a name="curse1"></a>- ~1253 BT. 
  The reason being over-mining of <span class="char_name"><a href="#orichalculum">orichalculum</a></span> 
  and people turning into werewolves (lychantrophy) as the side effect of orichalculum. 
  The village is being attacked by werewolves and some other beasts (likely some 
  minions of <a href="#guardians">the guardians</a> who want halt orichalculum 
  production). In legends, however, it was a pack of wolves who attacked the village 
  and their den was eliminated by some brave heroes who sacrificed their lives 
  to save others. What truly happened is that finally those who had lychantrophy 
  left the village and went to live somewhere in or under the mountains. </p>
<p><span class="char_name">Curse nr.2</span> <a name="curse2"></a>- took place 
  recently and still lasts. The time span between those two curses is large enough 
  for people to forget what happened. </p>
<h3>Thorsby <a name="thorsby"></a></h3>
<p>Around ~1600 BT a very large warcamp is founded in the <a href="#regions_places_map">Southern 
  Continent</a>. The buildings are longhouses made of wood but the wall is made 
  of stone. The camp has a very strict discipline and is also used as training 
  camp. No warrior is allowed to leave the camp for more than 2-3 days if not 
  on a mission. And no women are allowed inside the camp - this rule will be changed 
  soon due to the &quot;shieldmaidens&quot;; they will have a private section 
  in the camp. Later this warcamp evolves into the largest norsemen city on the 
  Southern Contient. It will be free city.</p>
<h2>Norse Writing<a name="norse_writing"></a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Orichalculum <a name="orichalculum"></a></h2>
<p>Orichalculum is not a natural resource, it is pure magic. It not a metal at 
  all, it just looks like one - materialized in that form. Orichalculum was made 
  by <a href="#vargfolk">vargfolk</a>. After some catastrophe they imprisoned 
  themselves in orichalculum to save their race. And because of that orichalculum 
  is very dangerous - a demonic metal. Vargfolk did not know the sideeffects of 
  their &quot;metal&quot; to <a href="#humans">humans</a> or other <span class="char_name">inferior 
  races</span>.. Not that they cared much anyway at that time. Their goal was 
  to conserve vargfolk essence, try to reach some other <a href="#ancientraces">superior 
  being</a> in order to make it one of the vargfolk. So, they were hoping that 
  one day vargfolk can be reborn by taking over and transforming some members 
  of other ancient races, who are strong and powerful enough to &quot;host&quot; 
  them. </p>
<p>Anyway, if one is exposed to orichalculum for too long, one starts turning 
  into a <a href="#werewolf" class="char_name">werewolf</a>. Lycanthropy is a disease caused by orichalculum. One starts 
  turning into a member of vargfolk. But humans are not strong enough for such 
  transformation - their transformation fails and instead the result is some kind 
  of freak, who has bloodlust etc. Vargfolk were just indifferent to other races 
  and because of that often brutal, uncaring. But this failed transformation - 
  <a href="#werewolf" class="char_name">werewolf</a> - has bloodlust instead, it is a beast. <span class="char_name">Orichalculum 
  is vargfolk now</span> - it is a living metal, it possesses vargfolk's spirit. 
  It has ambitions etc. Now that it knows its side-effects it wants to get into 
  the hands of some powerful being, one of the ancient races.<br>
  <br>
  However, Laurelin is now the original source of the metal - so there is quite 
  a bit of orichalculum about. But it is hard to get (it's deep and not dense), 
  so lot of work would go into getting enough of it in order to make one weapon. 
  During the Expansion norsemen made a special fort in some mountains outside 
  of the Valley (still on the island), where the smiths learned the art of forging 
  orichalculum and they started making &quot;weapons of the gods&quot;. These 
  were just stronger than normal weapons - cut better, didn't wear etc - , but 
  nowhere near the sword of <a href="#gormthewanderer">Holy Might</a> (Gorm's 
  sword i suppose). They were usually made of orichalculum mixed with some other 
  metals, not of pure orichalculum. Later they called mages to aid them making 
  weapons - so those orichalculum weapons became enchantable and even more powerful. 
  And this enchantment is different from the one granted to ordinary weapons - 
  if you inscribe runes on an orichalculum weapon forged by fire and magic, it 
  will have special abilities (returning to owners hand, perhaps healing and other 
  spells). Preparing orichalculum and making the weapons is very dangerous though 
  - not only the risk of lycanthropy but also getting damage, poison etc while 
  doing it and it would have a high fail rate, if it fails it might produce even 
  worse weapons than normal metals (cursed ones, very heavy ones etc). The wielder 
  of a orichalculum weapon can not survive without the help of a <span class="char_name"><a href="#seers">seer</a></span> 
  - so, <span class="char_name"><a href="#ulfhedin">ulfhedins</a></span> are dependant 
of seers in order to stay human and not to die.</p>
<p>One attempt to make a pure orichalculum weapon succeeded during the Golden 
  Age - it was <span class="char_name">Silverfang</span> <a name="silverfang_temp"></a>, 
  forged by a powerful hermit mage. He alone discovered the secret of orichalculum 
  and knew how to manipulate it.<span class="quote"> </span>And this is probably 
  exactly what vargfolk wanted someone to do since orichalculum is a tool, a hope 
  for vargfolk to return to this world. If Silverfang ever gets into the hands 
  of some superior being, the purpose of orichalculum is fulfilled. And preventing 
  something like this from happening is exactly what the guardian spirits were 
  created for - so, if <a href="werewolf_design_doc.html" target="design_doc">Berrin</a> 
  and the Silverfang would ever even think about leaving the valley, then this 
  is not something guardians would look kindly upon.</p>
<h2>Rebels <a name="rebels"></a></h2>
<p>... also known as <span class="char_name">traditionalists</span> or conservatives. 
  They emerged after Bjornolf the Wise was murdered ~430 BT. Some of them fled 
  to cave forts. They were the <span class="char_name">opposition at The Time 
  of Kings</span>. Traditionalists honor old ways and think the new ones show 
  the degeneration of norsemen. They want back the clan based community or at 
  least something like it was at the time of Ulf the Grey or his son Bjornolf 
  the Wise. Some of them don't like that raids are not so common now and that 
  trading relations are more valued. Among traditionalists there are most of the 
  old elite warriors (berserks, shieldmaidens, ulfhedin if any is left) and they 
  don't see the &quot;new world&quot; having a honorable place for them. <span class="char_name">Western 
  Kingdom</span> is perhaps the only kingdom that can be said to be on friendly 
  terms with the rebels. Hearn Hawkeye was an old warrior and he gave his daughter 
  to be raised by fosterparents among the rebels - almost as she were a boy. Audhild 
  the Red became a shieldmaiden and not only the greatest queen of Western Kingdom, 
  but also one of the mightiest rulers during The Time of Kings. Sven the Bearstrangler 
  sought alliance with the rebels too and with their aid managed to unite most 
  of the norsemen areas under his rule. He ruled for about 50 years, but in the 
  end he was assassinated (rumor says, the rebels did it).</p>

<h3>Nordic ships<a name="nordic_ships"></a></h3>
<p>Were <span class="char_name">longships <a name="longships"></a></span> like 
  the ones real vikings had. Real longships were fast, faster than anything at 
  that time. Their normal travel speed was about 10-11 knots, max speed 14-15 
  knots...and 4-5 knots with no wind. They travelled about 100 miles a day on 
  the average <span class="comment">(that's what has been proved by rebuilding 
  their ships; we have not been able to reproduce the rigging, so it might have 
  been greater even)</span>. They take off faster than the sailing ships today 
  <span class="comment">(a contest was held between the two - the ship with modern 
  technology had higher top speed but got a slower start)</span>. They stop at 
  night if they are near to land. With stormy weather they try to keep to the 
  sea - as far of land and breakers as possible. Viking philosophy was that it 
  is safer to be on the sea during the storms. <br>

<h2>Silverfang <a name="silverfang"></a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Time of Kings <a name="timeofthekings"></a></h2>
<p>The Time of the Kings lasts ~500 - 100 BT. It starts with Ulf the Grey. Here 
  is the list of the most important historical persons of that time:</p>
<h3>Ulf the Grey <a name="ulfthegrey"></a></h3>
<p>The First and Greatest King of Norsemen ~485-440 BT.<br>
  He is probably an <span class="char_name">ulfhedin</span> and well known and 
  respected among all clans. <br>
  ~500 BT he unites some smaller clans into one bigger one (~700 people).<br>
  Later he unites all the<span class="char_name"> clans</span> quite peacefully 
  under his leadership. This is a good &amp; profitable time for all norsefolk.<br>
  He also builds one of the first great <span class="char_name">stave houses</span>.<br>
  Legend tells that he died fighting a dragon. All norsemen mourned him greatly. 
  Ulf the Grey might have been about 200 years old when he died. He went to search 
  death. Legends differ in telling whether he killed the dragon or not.</p>
<h3>Bjornolf the Wise <a name="bjornolfthewise"></a></h3>
<p>King of Norsemen ~440-430 BT.<br>
  He is the son of <span class="char_name">Ulf the Grey</span>. Norsemen are convinced 
  that Ulf was the descendant of Gorm the Wanderer and think that one of his sons 
  should be their leader now. They choose Bjornolf the Wise, who manages to rule 
  the lands successfully until ~430 BT, when he is murdered (probably by his own 
  relatives or even brothers). Kingdom falls into chaos. About 20 nordic kingdoms 
  are born + about 4-6 kingdoms which are ruled by the natives and are independent 
  of norsemen. Some of those who were loyal to Bjornolf and those who just don't 
  like the new rulers and ways go into exile or retreat to cave-forts etc - they 
  are the first &quot;rebels&quot; or traditionalists. This marks the beginning 
  of the <span class="char_name">Great War</span>, civil war amongst norsemen 
  which lasts for 330 years.</p>
<h3>Hearn Hawkeye <a name="hearnhawkeye"></a></h3>
<p>Western King ~420-410 BT.<br>
  Hearn the Hawkeye unites the western/celtic areas into one kingdom - <span class="char_name">Western 
  Kingdom <a name="westernkingdom"></a></span>. Total amount of nordic kingdoms 
  at that time is ~15. He has made a pact with the <span class="char_name">rebels</span>, 
  in some ways he is a traditionalist himself. So in some ways this kingdom is 
  more similar to the ones of Ulf and Bjornolf than to the other kingdoms of his 
  time. He gives his daughter <span class="char_name">Audhild</span> to the rebel 
  camp to be raised as one of them. He probably dies in the battle.</p>
<h3>Njall the Farsighted <a name="njallfarsighted"></a></h3>
<p>Northern King (Middle-Lands) ~415-398 BT.<br>
  Njall the Farsighted develops a <span class="char_name">new runic alphabet </span>~408 
  BT. This will be used mainly for writing down laws etc. In other areas the runes 
  develop in time - some dissapear, some new ones are added etc.<br>
  Dies ~398 BT, his son <span class="char_name">Asvald the Handsome</span> inherits 
  the throne.</p>
<h3>Gjuki Eiligsson <a name="gjukieiligsson"></a></h3>
<p>Eastern trader-king, who starts a new buriral tradition ~415 BT, <span class="char_name">the 
  stone-barrows</span>. Soon other kingdoms follow the tradition, only the &quot;rebels&quot; 
  stick to the old ship-burnings.</p>
<h3>Eske the Sly <a name="eskethesly"></a></h3>
<p>Eastern King ~407-402 BT.<br>
  Unites the eastern areas. There are about 6 nordic kingdoms during his time 
  - 1 in west, 1 in the middle/north, 1 in east and the rest in south. He is the 
  husband of <span class="char_name">Brynja Dagsdatter</span>.</p>
<h3>Ragnhall Morgansson <a name="ragnhallmorgasson"></a></h3>
<p>The regent of Audhild the Red ~410- 405 BT.</p>
<h3>Audhild the Red <a name="audhildthered"></a></h3>
<p><span class="char_name">Western Ruler </span> ~405-370 BT.<br>
  She is the only daughter and offspring of <span class="char_name">Hearn Hawkeye</span> 
  (death ~410 BT ). She was brought up in a &quot;rebel&quot; camp, becoming a 
  <span class="char_name">shieldmaiden</span>. She inherits the throne at the 
  age of 13. Audhild the Red won't rule until she is 18 though - until that the 
  land is ruled by a council, the head of which is <span class="char_name">Ragnhall 
  Morgansson</span>. She conquers some more land during the first half of her 
  rule - so the amount of &quot;nordic&quot; kingdoms at that time is about 10-12. 
  She divides her country into smaller regions and makes it a law that each district 
  must be ready to send ships and men to her (the ruler) when it is needed. Such 
  a law is followed by many other kingdoms.<br>
  ~393 BT she marries <span class="char_name">Asvald the Handsome</span> and helps 
  him to squash the Eastern Kingdom. Upon discovering that her young husband wants 
  not only the eastern lands, but also their queen <span class="char_name">Brynja 
  Dagsdatter</span>, she kills them both and unites their realms to hers - this 
  is the biggest kingdom anyone has seen since the death of Bjornolf the Wise. 
  Together there are about 6-7 kingdoms at that time. <span class="char_name">Gormbsy 
  </span>becomes the capital of the <span class="char_name">&quot;western kingdom&quot;,</span> 
  the vast kingdom of Audhild the Red.<br>
  Audhild the Red dies ~370 BT. Supposedly in the battle against the free city 
  Thorsby <span class="comment">(a large city on southern continent, still has 
  the big stronghold that was established at the end of Long War; have to still 
  ponder about the reason of this attack, it was probably something personal - 
  an important family member killed or imprisoned perhaps).</span></p>
<h3>Asvald the Handsome <a name="asvaldthehandsome"></a></h3>
<p> The son on <span class="char_name">Njall the Farsighted</span>; inherits the 
  throne of <span class="char_name">Middle-Lands</span> <span class="comment">(we 
  could also call it Northern Kingdom, since the king of Middle-Lands resides 
  on Northern Continent, in Gormbsy)</span> ~398 BT. Right after becoming king 
  he attacks the Eastern Kingdom to revenge <span class="char_name">Brynja Dagsdatter</span>, 
  the eastern queen and the widow of Eske the Sly. Brynja Dagsdatter hurt Asvalds 
  pride once, jilting him and choosing a wealthy merchant as her next spouse instead. 
  The war is lost almost immediately since Asvalds forces are no match against 
  the mercenary army Brynja has hired. <br>
  ~393 BT Asvald the Handsome and the western queen <span class="char_name">Audhild 
  the Red</span> form an alliance by marriage. Together they conquer the Eastern 
  Kingdom. But once Audhild realizes his husband wants Brynja, she kills them 
  both and unites their realms to hers. </p>
<h3>Brynja Dagsdatter <a name="brynjadagsdatter"></a></h3>
<p>Eastern Ruler ~402 - 393 BT.<br>
  As the young but manipulative wife of <span class="char_name">Eske the Sly</span> 
  she inherits his throne. Many nobles and kings offer her a marriage. She promises 
  herself to <span class="char_name">Asvald the Handsome</span>, son of Njall 
  the Farsighted. She breaks that promise however and marries the head of of a 
  rich trader-family instead. Insulted Asvald wants to start a war but is his 
  father prohibits him to do that. Asvald the Handsome becomes northern king ~398 
  BT, attack Brynja and is beaten my her mercenary army. He will have his revenge 
  ~393 BT however by marrying powerful western queen <span class="char_name">Audhild 
  the Red</span> and defeating the Eastern Kingdom. Brynja is soon killed by Audhild. 
</p>
<h3>Bjorn the Blessed <a name="bjorntheblessed"></a></h3>
<p>An South-Eastern king who became to power after the previous king was killed 
  by his own folk as a sacrifice during one especially dry summer which caused 
  great famine (~350 BT). <span class="comment">It was an act of great desperation, 
  not something norsemen usually do. But this southern area was also influenced 
  by native traditions and beliefs, so perhaps it was a very ancient and rare 
  tradition of that region, one that had its roots in pre-norsemen times.</span> 
  Bjorn is not the blood relative of the previous king and will be known as Bjorn 
  the Blessed since during his time fields flourish etc.</p>
<h3>Audolf the Stonecutter <a name="audolfthestonecutter"></a></h3>
<p>Western King ~302-289 BT.<br>
  His achievements include paving the streets of <span class="char_name">Gormsby</span> 
  ~300 BT, the capital of <span class="char_name">&quot;western kingdom&quot; 
  </span>and later doing so in every other important city of his domain. He is 
  mostly known for ripping apart the Western Kingdom though - he <span class="char_name">divides</span> 
  it between his daughter and 2 sons ~289 BT. These 3 will rule the land quite 
  peacefully for a while, until the brothers fall in love with <span class="char_name">Annot 
  Greeneyes</span> and have a duel. The result leaves the kingdom in chaos and 
  in ~282 - 275 BT <span class="char_name">Civil War</span> erupts in Western 
  Kingdom. A coalition of some influential nobles sees this as an opportunity 
  to seize power. This causes a civil war. . The treacherous nobles are also aided 
  by outside forces (some other kingdoms) and manage to kill or exile the representatives 
  of old royal line. Together with relicts &quot;western kingdom&quot; there are 
  about 14-18 kingdoms now.</p>
<h3>Annot Greeneyes <a name="annotgreeneyes"></a></h3>
<p>A western noblewoman. Caused a conflict in ~284 BT. The sons of the western 
  king <span class="char_name">Audolf the Stonecutter</span> fell in love with 
  her. They had a duel and one brother was killed. The other surrendered the throne 
  and became a hermit. </p>
<h3> Sven the Bearstrangler <a name="svenbearstrangler"></a></h3>
<p>Ruler of Western Kingdom since ~160 BT. One of the great kings, the last one 
  too. <span class="char_name">Supreme King </span>aka<span class="char_name"> 
  Ruler of All Norsemen</span> ~150-100 BT; in order to achieve that he made a 
  pact with &quot;rebels&quot;, who perhaps executed him publicly later. <span class="comment">How 
  he died must be given some thought still.</span> His death marks the <span class="char_name">end 
  of the Time of Kings</span>. Built a <span class="char_name">Great Stone Fort 
  </span>~155 BT.</p>
<h2>Traders and Diplomates<a name="traders"></a></h2>
<p>Traders distinguish more and more as a class during <span class="char_name">The 
  Time of Kings</span>. And they gain more and more power. Perhaps this happened 
  already during the expansions. <br>
  <br>
  There have always been <span class="char_name">trading outposts</span> - <span class="char_name">military 
  outposts</span> that have grown into trading towns. Some of these settlements 
  are on the some island (in the sea, at some pass or in a larger lake), some 
  at the mouth of the river(s), some in some bay. All these settlements have similar 
  structure - the most important thing being that they are all harbour-settlements 
  and have a semicircle wall facing inland. These settlements grow into towns 
  in time and enable the evolving of traders and crafters. But at first they are 
  more raider-harbours or military harbours still - the evolving of traders and 
  crafters as a distinct profession will occur somewhere between ~1400 - 400 BT 
  or something perhaps. </p>
<p>Land is a property in the trading towns already long before ~700-500 BT. In 
  trading towns land was already sold and bought for some time. But now few clans 
  start stressing their <span class="char_name">ownership of the land </span>they 
  are living on. Also more and more sons want their separate houses - so <span class="char_name">log-houses</span> 
  are being built too (separate houses for animals etc were built already before). 
  Today <span class="char_name">long-houses</span> are only some central buildings 
  perhaps. </p>
<p><span class="char_name">Diplomats</span> also emerge during the Time of the 
  Kings. Actually, many kings themselves prefer to be diplomats and leave the 
  fighting to their inferiors if needed. </p>
<h2>Warriors<a name="warriors"></a></h2>
<p>Basically we have 3 kinds of elite warriors:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Berserk <a name="herbalberserk"></a></h3>
<p>Berserk is also called <span class="char_name">ordinary </span>or <span class="char_name">chemical/herbal 
  berserk</span>. Basically, they need herbalists to provide the <span class="char_name">herb/potion 
  </span>which they consume before the battle. The time of the effect of this 
  potion varies based on the individual berserk skill and quality/quantity of 
  the potion. They can go into rage in that time range (they don't have to do 
  it right after taking the herb/potion). So, basically they are just elite fighters 
  dedicated to war and perhaps some drug. However, they have important qualities 
  - they do not die during the fight and they kill anyone who crosses their path. 
  In the case of the normal/chemical berserker they are just numbed by the drug 
  and can not tell friend from foe most of the time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ulfhedin <a name="ulfhedin"></a></h3>
<p>Ulfhedins were the protectors, bodyguards of the <span class="char_name">seers 
  </span>even during the time of <span class="char_name">vargfolk</span>. These 
  warriors were &quot;modified&quot; by the seers. Many things were needed for 
  creating them. After the demise of vargfolk and the slaughter of some elder 
  seers the ulfhedin tradition perished. Last original ulfhedin died out about 
  a century after the demise of vargfolk. <br>
  The ulfhedin tradition came into life again after ~2700 BT, when <span class="char_name">orichalculum</span> 
  mining started in the Laurelin valley. Seers (who had forgotten all their ancestors 
  once knew)<span class="quote"> </span>probably discovered by accident, that 
  orichalculum makes some warriors into ulfhedin. They had no idea, that vargfolk 
  is imprisoned inside the metal. Without the help of a seer the person who transformed 
  into ulfhedin dies. But basically an ulfhedin berserk can be real powerful. 
  Ulfhedin were and are hard to create elite warrior types, holy warriors.<br>
  One idea was that ulfhedin carry around orichalculum charms or drink a potion 
  that is made in an orichalculum bowl or vial...or is actually made from orichalculum 
  or plants affected by it (growing above it). Now they turn into awful werewolves...at 
  will...very strong beasts, stronger than normal. <br>
  While in their trance ulfhedin berserks are wild beasts who in their rage (lasts 
  a couple of hours or so) do not discriminate while killing - friend or foe, 
  it doesn't matter. Ulfhedin is a lot stronger than chemical berserk. They are 
  basically a bit like werewolves, but stronger than those since they don't feel 
  pain. But they can turn back after the battle - i think they can turn back into 
  humans at will or something. If their wounds are too great - they will die after 
  turning back, they will not die of wounds during battle though. So, basically 
  ulfhedins are ultimate berserks.<br>
  <br>
  Ulfhedin are still around today and players with very high willpower and high 
  fighter skills can choose to play them or other elite warrior types. They are 
  not werewolves, they do not have bloodlust. Using their willpower they just 
  force themselves to transform temporarily. Ulfhedin is sort of like a last resort 
  - I will die in another blow - I will turn into this beast and possibly live. 
</p>
<p>Their power is not passed on. They either do not have descendants or their 
  offsprings are regular humans. <span class="comment">In ulfhedin state a player 
  will not be able to make descendants, his/her child will inherit none of the 
  ulfhedin abilities - it is not something that can be inherited.</span></p>
<p><img src="../../media/concept-artwork/players/ulfhedin_rough_02.jpg" width="700" height="510"><br>
</p>
<p class="char_desc"> A very rough sketch of an ulfhedin in the raged state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shieldmaiden <a name="shieldmaiden"></a></h3>
<p> Shieldmaidens are elite female warriors - something like seraphims or valkyries. 
  <span class="comment">This idea is really vague</span>. Generally, women in 
  our game are better than men in some areas, but being a warrior is harder for 
  them. The few who decide to take the rough path can become these elite warriors 
  though. Women can probably become berserks and ulfhedins too. Ulfhedin just 
  require extremely high willpower, so that's the same for both men and women. 
  However, berserks also require very high strength, so women probably have to 
  work a lot harder to achieve that since their physical strength is naturally 
  lower. Female berserks or ulfhedin wouldn't look pretty either - rather barbaric, 
  very muscular etc. So, becoming berserk or ulfhedin is a lot more difficult 
  and less appealing for women. </p>
<p>Shieldmaiden may not be as strong as berserk or ulfhedin, but she doesn't have 
  the negative sides those 2 have. She doesn't have rage and the drain of energy 
  etc, she is always the same- for example she is always strong etc, she doesn't 
  have to get into some kind of state to use her special abilites. Basically, 
  they are not berserks, they just have special skills. </p>
<h2>Wars<a name="wars"></a></h2>
<h3>Seers vs Dragons <a name="seersVSdragons"></a></h3>
<p>~10 000 - 9800 BT armies led by seers fight against dragons. They are defeated 
  and scattered all around the world though - wandering without permanent home. 
  Norsemen, one of those who served the seers, will find their home almost 4000 
  years later, namely ~6000 BT they will settle on a continent relatively close 
  to where their &quot;gods&quot; used to dwell. </p>
<h3>Clan X vs Clan Y <a name="clan_vs_clan"></a></h3>
<p>~3030 BT A war or feud between clan X and clan Y. It can end with the death 
  of the leaders or persons who started it (sometime after ~3000 BT then) or it 
  can last for generations. It could also begin earlier than this. <span class="comment">Haven't 
  given it much thought actually, could as well take it out of the history.</span></p>
<h3>War With the &quot;Chinese&quot;<a name="war_with_the_chinese2" id="war_with_the_chinese2"></a></h3>
<p>The Sea-Battle In Far-Eastern Waters and its consequences bring an abrupt end 
  to the First Wave of Expansion, since ~2400 - 2395 BT an <span class="char_name">invasion 
  by the &quot;chinese&quot;</span> takes place. Norsemen call them The Sea-Beast 
  Lords. &quot;Chinese fleet&quot; comes to explore and take revenge. All norsemen 
  clans unite to defeat this enemy - <span class="char_name">largest &quot;ting&quot;</span> 
  ever is held to decide this. War goes mainly on in the coastal waters and coastal 
  regions. Nobody is losing or winning. &quot;Chinese&quot; just suddenly end 
  the war by sailing away (possibly because they were called back and didn't find

<h3>The Long War <a name="longwar"></a></h3>
<p>Is the war that lasted for 500 years (~2100 - 1600 BT), thus it put a long 
  gap between Second and Third Expansion Wave. With this war norsemen strengthened 
  their presence on the southern continent however (Thorsby).</p>
<h3>The Great War <a name="greatwar"></a></h3>
<p>Great War is a civil war among norsemen that lasts for over 300 years (~430 
  - 100 BT). It starts with the death of Bjornolf the Wise. Great War is a general 
  name for a time of great confusion and unrest. Basically The Time of Kings and 
  Great War seem to be one and the same - that because nordic kindgoms are never 
  truly at piece. Most of the kingdoms - except for a few - don't even survive 
  long enough to make themselves known to the world. So, the kingdoms fight with 
  eachother. And they also fight with the rebels. And there are also fights that 
  are internal to a single kingdom. For example Civil War in Western Kingdom (~289 
  BT).</p>
<h2>Werewolves <a name="werewolf"></a></h2>
<p>Turning into werewolves is a disease - lycanthropy, an infection. Namely, if 
  a human gets his/her hands on orichalculum, s/he might start changing into the 
  race that possesses the metal, into vargfolk. But since humans are animals by 
  nature - they get bloodlust. Humans are too weak to be able to cope with physical 
  transformation into vargfolk - so, the process fails and the result is some 
  kind of abomination. The transformation will not take place immediately of course. 
  <span class="comment">We haven't agreed on the exact time range one has to be 
  exposed to the metal, but it could take couple of generations even or at least 
  decades, depending on the concentration of orichalculum of course.</span></p>
<p>Depending on the amount of blood s/he gets and skills s/he has a werewolf would 
  be able to live a very long time. This doesn't mean that the human side will 
  stay in control. Anyway, assuming that a werewolf gets enough fresh kills all 
  the time, werewolves would live a bit longer than humans. Seers and werewolves 
  would likely live up to 500 years if given the chance. Powerful ones even longer.</p>
<p>  Humans are not worthy of the transfomation. They would eventually die from the 
  transformation. They need blood of the other beings in order not die. <br>
  It is not wise for a werewolf to get a child since it would be something not 
accepted into their socitey (nor human or wolfish).</p>
<p>About the Laurelin Werewolves During the First Curse:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During the first curse people were being turned into Werewolves due to exposure of orichalculum. Many of these turned were miners who were exposed to orichalculum over a long period of time. Some unlucky craftsmen who worked with the metal were also turned as well. </li>
  <li>The mining during this time had been steadily on the rise since outside forces demanded more and more orichalculum and a somewhat safe method of transporting it to the mainland had been arranged.  </li>
  <li>These new werewolves slaughtered the folk of Laurelin. </li>
  <li>The werewolves slowly figured out who and what they were.&nbsp; Grief stricken, almost all of them headed as far away from people as they could.&nbsp; Some probably couldn't come to terms with who and what they were and stayed in their homes.&nbsp; Eventually they were killed by hunters while in their wolf form most likely.  </li>
  <li>Eventually (over a period of many months) the werewolves started bumping in to one another in the woods and they figured out that they weren't alone with this affliction.&nbsp; So after a period of a few years they started living among each other in the mountains which are largely inaccessible to folks since the first curse is in full swing. </li>
  <li>The werewolves are of course grief stricken by what they have done to their fellow villagers.&nbsp; The werewolves think that surely they have done something to anger the gods and that they are being punished.&nbsp; Being vikings they cannot commit suicide...&nbsp; it is simply not an option since everyone knows where vikings go who commit suicide.</li>
  <li>Once the werewolves begin to understand their affliction a bit better they are able to manage it to a degree.&nbsp; For example they know they need to feed, what they can feed upon without killing humans and they are even starting to develop the ability to control their bloodlust to a very small degree.&nbsp; Eventually the werewolves begin to come to terms with what they had done.&nbsp; So the werewolves decide that they will now try to protect the village / villagers from harm.&nbsp; The villagers think, perhaps if they atone for their sins by protecting the villagers the gods will have mercy on them and transform back to normal. </li>
  <li>Werewolves have *exceptionally* long life spans inherited from their "fathers" the Vargfolk.&nbsp; Probably thousands (maybe even 10's or 100's of thousands) of years.&nbsp; I'd have to look in our old notes to see what we agreed upon.&nbsp; A small matter though since it is a very very long time at any rate.  </li>
  <li>So after approx. ~25-50 years after the first curse had been lifted the werewolves start patrolling around the village and helping out wherever they can while still minimizing their contact with humans.&nbsp; They werewolves are still not 100% in control of the beast which lurks inside them so they try to minimize contact with humans. </li>
  <li>After many years stories start to get around Laurelin about wolves that stalk the forest protecting the village and villagers.&nbsp; Up to this point the image of the wolf in Laurelin had been one of terror.&nbsp; Over a period of many hundreds of years with the wolf protecting them the Laurelin villagers began to respect and honor the symbol of the wolf.&nbsp; Of course everyone knows the story of the ravening of the wolves (which we're discussing right now) so this honor and respect is tempered with a bit of fear.&nbsp; In much the same way a child might respect, honor and even love an adult that same child yet fears the wrath of the adult should the child displease them.&nbsp; So it slowly became with the villagers of Laurelin and their impressions of wolves.&nbsp; Laureliners feel that wolves are mystical creatures to be honored and revered.&nbsp; Yet the anger of the wolf is a terrible thing to be avoided at all costs.&nbsp; If the wolves are angry however, obviously the villagers did something to provoke this anger... </li>
