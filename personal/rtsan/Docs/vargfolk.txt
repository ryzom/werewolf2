Vargfolk male discussion
======================================================================

1) Where do they have hair
	1.1 See drawing.
2) Are they very muscular?
	2.1 yes.  they are very imposing physically
3) How long are their claws compared to the female?
4) Do they have any weapons other than claws and magic?
5) What clothing do they wear usually?
6) Where do they have tattos for sure?
	6.1 See drawing.
7) Are they more or less magical than females
	7.1 there is no innate difference in magical aptitude, but females are more interested in magic and therefore are better at it than males.
8) Is there any real difference between female and male vargfolk? Are they born as male/female?
	8.1 Vargfolk are energy-beings, their physical form is their own preference.
	8.2 Female/male is actually a choice of presenting itself, not smth you are born with. Although, one chooses its gender based on the its nature. So one can say that the female/male difference is initially not something physical, but rather it lies in the character and mindset of the individual.
	8.3 There is probably one special streak that distinguishes female/male vargfolk. Female streak is probably patience or something like that, male streak is agressiveness or smth like that.
9) What positions do they occupy socially vs. females (what if any role does gender play)
	8.1  High council consists mostly of female vargfolk bc it's important for the members of high council to be skilled in all magic skilltrees possible for vargfolk and achieving that needs patience. So basically females have a higher position in vargfolk society.
10) How does their magic differ from that of females
11) How do their proportions differ from a normal humans?
12) How tall do they get
	11.1 approx 3.5-4 meters
13) What is their attitude towards other races?
	12.1 Even more hostile towards other races than females are.  More likely to kill you than talk to you
	12.2 More physically impulsive (will kill w/o thinking about it once)
	12.3 Very little involvement with seers and other races (this was for females largely)
14) Males are the warriors and generals.  Females are more subtle.
15) What are they composed of / what is their nature?
	14.1 Pure energy..  Non-corporeal.
	14.2 This is their natural state (change this in encyclopedia)
	

======================================================================
What ancients are left? (left alive by vargfolk)
======================================================================
______________________________________________________________________
I) Too powerful to kill before
	I.1) Gaea
		* Powers: Create life and control the living.
		* Alignment: Force for "good" - quite partial towards life and the living obviously.
		* Quantity and lifespan: Only ancient race ever to be a single entity. She can manifest 
		  herself in any of her creation and often do that simultaneously - even (talk to several 
		  people in different places). But if the true form is tracked down - there is only one of it. 
		  Not immortal, but with an infinite lifespan.
		* Notes: To kill her you must kill everything living.
	I.2) Angels of Death
		* Powers: Control over life and death.
		* Alignment: Completely neutral. They have no feelings what so ever. So generally they have
		  nothing to do with the affairs of other ancients or any beings for that matter.
		  Hence they do not even care what the Vargfolk have done or were planning to do. They are Death,
		  The Grim Reapers, when someone dies they are there "to help the individual over to the other
		  side". Although there probably is no other side and they are more like erasers of life, an 
		  individual ceases to exist, in reality.
		* Quantity and lifespan: Several beings. Completely immortal.
	I.3) Guardians of Heaven.
		* Powers: Guarding. This means all sorts of seals, traps, force barriers and so on.
		* Alignment: A great force for "good". They guarded some of the most important secrets
		  and relics of Gaea and others.
		* Quantity and lifespan: There were quite a lot of them. However they offered their
		  lives basically to have Gaea create what are now known as The Guardian Spirits for
		  Laurelin. They perish when they fail to do their protection duties usually.
	I.4) Creators
		* Powers: Create matter.
		* Alignment: Completely neutral.
		* Quantity and lifespan: Bunch of guys :) 125k years.
		* Notes: They are too far away in deep space. Vargfolk have no clue about them.
	I.5) Chaos
		* Powers: Illusion, teleportation, posession, summoning.
		* Alignment: crazy evil guys
		* Quantity and lifespan: Just a few (special breed born of any race)
		* Notes: They really piss off the vargfolk.
	I.5) Chronos
		* Powers: Control of time
		* Alignment: Generally neutral, but still with morals on the "good" side of things.
		* Quantity and lifespan: Just a few left (infinite lifespan but mortal [very hard to kill and very powerful])
		* Notes: They were the last ones to have a war with the Vargfolk. The Vargfolk had
		  already gained most of their powers and were mostly in the ellimintation stage. However
		  it proved very difficult to fight against time. So they probably were making some sort of
		  the device to aid them in that - the plan backfired and they ended up underground.

______________________________________________________________________
II) Too weak to be of any interest or something like that
	II.1) Dragons
		* Powers: Strong beasts. Some control over fire. Mild telepathy (added by vargfolk to
		  enable smooth communication).
		* Alignment: Animal nature. So sort of neutral. The ones that have more intelligence are
		  "evil" rather than "good", since they try to find better ways of getting
		  food and stuff.
		* Quantity and lifespan:  Not many left alive. More powerful chained up to awaken when
		  the vargfolk return or perish.
	II.2) Some chinese gods
		* Powers: Summoning.
		* Alignment: Varying alignment.
		* Quantity and lifespan: Quite a lot. 1-2k years.
	II.3) Voodoo Gods
		* Powers: Necromancy and some divination.
		* Alignment: A little evil.
		* Quantity and lifespan: A few hundred. 1k years.
		* Notes: They live among the people as the great shamans. They are the leaders of their tribes.
	II.4) The Divine Gods
		* Powers: Divination.
		* Alignment: Good generally.
		* Quantity and lifespan: A lot! 1-2k years.
		* Notes: They REALLY like to play god :)

Vargfolk managed to hide away most of the items, but some "trivial things" were forgotten, kind of like someone leaving his toothbrush or socks behind - those things that mean nothing special to vargfolk mean a great deal for humans. Almost all of these items were found by the seers and is kept in Gormsby.  The few that aren't found are likely very far away from Gormsby.
	* relics for vargfolk too - they have items that they valued highly back in the day too. Maybe a core from the star where they were all born (maybe it holds a key to destroy them). Seeing stones of the known universe (like the dome in the X-Men where they would look for other mutants/other powerful beings that have "cheese"). Remains of some vargfolk that has died in a piece of orichalculum (these are how these remains are interned; they had orichalculum long before tha catastrophe; kind of sarcophagus-method, except not for body but rather soul).

	* killed one of the guardians
36) What are the vargfolk's powers now that they are imprisoned?

41) What about mates?  Is it lifelong?  What is their family structure like?
	* they do have husbands / wives and their coupling is lifelong. Varfolk idealises harmony. They realise that there are two distinct mentalities inside the race. Yin and yang kind of thing. Patient/impatient. So a couple = harmony. 
	* a child must always have 2 parents, a couple must raise him/her. Creating a new vargfolk individual (kind of giving birth) requires a lot of vargfolk individuals or a few very powerful ones. Members of high council could even "give birth" with 1-2 of them being present, but that would be a senseless waste of energy. 
	* the couples are mentors to younger vargfolk. Even if the child is "conceived and given birth to" by many vargfolk individuals, he/she must be brought up by a couple who are appointed by the high council. In ideal case they are also the creators, "the real parents", but they could just be someone whose schedules are free so to say. 
	* they have a mild lineage thingy going on also. Meaning, who created them is very important -- the individuals potential depends on it. Who brought them up is a little less important.
42) How do they create another vargfolk?  Does it diminish themselves in any way?
	* to create a new vargfolk 4 or 5 get together and they create another vargfolk to create a new soul in a few weeks.  They need to take a vacation to the sun or something.
	* rebirth is easier (for a slain vargfolk)
43) How does their social order work?
	* Heirarchy is based on age and achievements in life
44) What is their style of dress?
	* dress in white
	* neat, clean lines
	* not much of it since they want to expose themselves to the sun as much as possible and to show off their tattoos
	* males have bare torsos and use robes
	* cloaks - to cover them up when they want to be more alert since sun makes them sleepy
	* Cloaks - might be used in a religious ceremony or to commemorate some bad event
	* Cloaks - then entrance man!  they look so really cool!
	* Cloaks - younger vargfolk might wear more clothing since they don't have a lot of tattoos to show off
45) How many seers and dragons did they control at their height?
	* Dragons - a few hundred (a 1/10th of them could riding)...  they kill their own (males kill the weaker ones and the young ones kill each other)
	* Seers - a hundred families (they're just families)
46) What is the nature of their physical bodies?
	* created with their bio-tech (so possession takes no effort( - they can now modify it at will with magic with some magical cost - can also change form with their biotech
