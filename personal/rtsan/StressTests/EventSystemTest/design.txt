* Measuring:
	* time between sending and getting the message
* Factors
	* Message size
	* FPS
	* # broadcasters
	* # pre-listeners
	* # event handlers
	* # post-listeners
	* # total listeners
	* # filters
	* message sending frequency

* Highly accurate timer - ability to run several at once (a clock or a lot of timers) (GetTickCount()?)
* Sources
	* Constant
	* Range function


Test case:

	Set fps: 500
	Set num broadcasters: 100
	Set num listeners: 100
	Set message interval: random 1ms..500ms
	Set num messages: 100 per broadcaster
	Set run time: 10s
	For message size in 2..100, 2
