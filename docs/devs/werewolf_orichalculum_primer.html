		<p>This is a <span class="important"><strong>DEVELOPERS ONLY</strong></span> document.  This document <span class="important"><strong>WILL</strong></span> contain spoilers and is definitely not intended for prospective Werewolf players. If you are reading this may your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth with a thousand caramels so that you may never speak a word of it to anyone!</p>
		<p>This document is intended to be an introduction to the wonderous metal Orichalculum, its origins, uses, appearance and place in the history of the world. This document was composed in order to serve as a reference to story writers and world builders. It goes without saying that many of the things contained in this document should never be known to players as to preserve the mystery of our world.</p>
		<H2><A name="origins">II. Origins</A></H2>
		<p>In reality Orichalculum is not a metal at all.  At least it is not a naturally appearing one.  The true origins of Orichalculum stem back over 10,000 years ago and are known to no one, including the other ancients.</p>
		<p>The roots of Orichalculum stems from the now forgotten Vargfolk. An ancient race unto themselves and very magical the Vargfolk constantly experimented with very powerful magical forces.</p>
		<p>Of course since there are no real facts known about Orichalculum the Vikings have largely made up their own legends about the metal since so little is really known. </p>

		Two kinds of meshes are accepted:
		
<DIV class="indent1"> <B>1)</B> A medium resolution (1500-2000k triangles per 
  character for example) mesh that can be simplified for lower polycounts or subdivided 
  for higher polycounts. It is recommended that the original of this mesh would 
  mostly be quads, because it is easier for humans to "read" and thus easier to 
  simplify. Also subdividing quads gives better results. </DIV>
		
<DIV class="indent1"> <B>2)</B> NURBS meshes - low and highpoly versions can be 
  derived directly from this.
</DIV>
		The published meshes should always be triangles. Altho to make the life 
of texturers, riggers and animators easier - it should be left at quads until 
the final product.<br>
Characters should have separate eye and hair meshes - </P> that is, if there is 
a big hairy area it shoud have a swappable hair mesh. So model your characters 
bald.

<p>Need a standard here... bipeds, quadrupeds etc. The standards should/could 
  be derived off of each other...so maybe animations can be combined...like you 
  could have a quadruped walk animation and you can combine that with some wing 
  animation to apply it to say a dragon or pegasus. All that needs is probably 
  that the bone naming be the same for the bones they have in common.<br>
  Other then that...we need some ways to simplify and unify both the rigging and 
  animating process. One way is to use the shared weight maps - need a tool for 
  that. A general rigging system is probably impossible to create as people use 
  different applications - but we should try to go as far as possible, since this 
  is the basis for good animation :)<br>
  Riggers! Orient your local axes correctly! Do NOT make life miserable for animators! 
  Just to define what is &quot;correctly&quot; here goes: all joint placement 
  should be handled by the rotation of the parent joint coordinate system. The 
  x axis should run along the length of the bone and thus define it's direction. 
  Local translation should only be used for the root joint and for all other joints 
  restricted to the x axis. Also watch the orientation of those y and z axes - 
  make sure it makes sense for the current skeleton. Thank you! :)</p>
