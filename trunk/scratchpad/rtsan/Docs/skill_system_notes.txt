Need to model dSkill/dt
IMPORTANT!! A REALISTIC PREDICTABLE MODEL IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE.
=> The integral of dSkill*dt will not have an analytic solution.

Sources of skill growth
========================
	* Training
	* Usage
	* Verbal tutoring (tips and such)
	* Magic (often temporary)
	* Growth of a complementary skill

Sources of skill degradation
=============================
	* Disuse
	* Growth of a contradicting skill
	* Degradation of a complementary skill
	* Magic	(often temporary)
↑↓↕Σ

Factors in skill growth
========================
	* Energy spent
		: energy↑ => dSkill↑
	* Proficiency with action (experience)
		: proficiency↑ => dSkill↓ 
	* Previous skill level
		: level↑ => dSkill↓
	* Abilities
		: ability↑ => dSkill↕
	* Time
		: dSkill/dt
	* Buffs
		: arbitrary
	* Sleep
		: based on previous values...complicated.
	* Levels of other skills
		: based on relationships

Factors in skill degradation
=============================
	* Time
	* Previous skill level
	* Abilities
	* Buffs
	* ?Injury?
	* Levels of other skills

Idea #1
=============
	Training based on work/energy. Each level has a work requirement determined by a growth model. Each training usage session gives some amount of energy with a cap. Without training/usage the work/energy levels put into the skill start to drop slowly. 
	Skills will continue to grow for a bit after a training session...a night of sleep is helpful.

MUSINGS
====================================

I Training
=================
* Quantitization
	Training can be quantitized by amount of energy spent and/or time spent.
	Note that a higher dEnergy/dt does not neccesarily provide better results
	and may actually damage the trainee.

* Forms of training
	a) repetition
		Effective in almost all cases. Time required is greater.
	b) understanding
		Not possible in all cases. Faster way to mastery.

* Under training
	Training less than a certain amount will not increase the skill.
	It merely counts as usage and keeps the skill from deteriorating.

* "Good" training
	The more you train the more you gain.
	The sweet spot is at the end of this region.
	Beyond that it becomes over training.

* Over training
	Beyond a certain point training will not increase the skill further
	and might even damage the trainee.

* Outside assistance
	Given a trainer or information (verbal or written or whatever) one can
	increase the effectiveness of training. Potentially escaping the under
	training phase. The effect will continue (altho lessen) until the
	information has been processed to perfection.

* Sleep/Time
	Many effects of the training will not be visible immediately after and
	will need at least time to set in. Sleep will certainly help in getting the full effect.

II Relationships with other skills
=================
* Quantitization
	?

* Positive influence on training
	Decreases degradation speed and increases training speed.
	Exponential relationship with skill level.

* Negative influence on training
	Increases degradation speed and decreases training speed.
	Exponential relationship with skill level.

* Supporting skills
	An increase in a supporting skill causes a corresponding increase in the skill.

* Opposing skills
	A decrease in an opposing skill causes a corresponding decrease in the skill.

* Mastery of many things
	Can not master too many things. Depending on intelligence etc.

III Injuries and other blocking conditions
=================
* Quantitization
	?

IV Buffs and other positive conditions
=================
* Quantitization
	?
