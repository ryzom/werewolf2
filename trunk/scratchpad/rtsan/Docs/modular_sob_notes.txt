// Definition
/////////////////////////////////
A system that provides the structure and service of dynamically manipulating presentation, logic and data of simulation objects.

* structure:
	datastructures and their collections.
* service:
	interface/facade to manipulate the structure in a nice way.
* dynamic manipulation:
	ability to manipulate during both creation and runtime, based on data, code or user input.
* presentation:
	accessing the object data in any way that results in a visible result for the user.
* logic:
	behaviour: actions initiated by the object itself.
	reaction: actions initiated by external stimuli.
* data:
	both static and variable properties of an object.
* simulation objects:
	objects that participate in the game simulation.

// UCs

UC1) Motion
	UC1.1) Player controlled entity moved via the keyboard and mouse
	UC1.2) Entity controlled by something on the network.
	UC1.3) Entity controlled by the server through AI and pathfinding logic.
	Some entities can not move/be moved.
UC2) Riding a mount
	A subcase of motion. Mount is controlled by UC1 (wild horse could be more like UC1.3..while a totally tame one is close to UC1.1)
	Entity is controlled by the motion of some other entity + additional logic.
	Some entities can not be ridden. Some entities can not ride others.
UC2) Eating
	Entity gains energy by consuming another object/entity. Some objects can not be eaten. Some entities can not eat.
UC3) Inventory
UC4) Equipment
Intoxication
Firebolt (targeted missile)
Icebolt (non-targeted se missile)
Fireball (non-targeted aoe missile)
Haste
Haste boots
Shadow door
Force field
