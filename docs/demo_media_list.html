	<P>All objects described here are Nordic in style and design. Artists should not limit themselves to strictly to only viking influences. It is also possible to use influences from celtic styles boldly
	(that goes esp for ornamentation). Influences from other cultures and influences  should be used mildly so that they don't dominate the design.
	Of course ours is a fantasy world and many things are possible within the bounds of believability.
	Most things should show a sense of history and have a strong sense of mood but if especially if put into a scene with similar objects. Refer to the other documents
	and existing concept art for more info about the atmosphere and style we're aiming for. We do have a fair bit of reference material gathered and also a number of base textures. Currently there is no universal place
	for sharing textures and reference material, however there is a system in development to fill this gap. As soon as this tool is available it will be mentioned in this document. In the meantime if you have a specific need please ask one of the developers and we'll provide you with whatever resources we have. </P>
	<P>3D assets which are contributed are expected to have multiple LODs, UV mapped and possibly a texture map (especially for simple models). 3D artists aren't exptected to be texture painters (although it is a plus of course). Please note that very simple models (such as a long log) are mostly about their texture - so very simple models in and of themselves would not be accepted..</P>
	<P>Also note that textures should be painted pretty large (as large as you are comfortable with it), but one should make sure they look decent at lower resolutions (expect things like 64x64 etc).
	The final size of the texture largely depends on the size and importance of the model on screen. However the less texture space it uses the better.
	And if one could do reuseable textures for things like generic wooden objects etc it'd be nice. Also note that multitexturing is possible.</P>
	<P>Models are of course polygonal and low poly at that. The aim is to make them look decent at every lod level tho. So do not be shy if the silhouette is really ruined
	by the low number of polygons. It is easier to reduce than to add. If a more complicated model/task comes your way, it would be nice to see a design mesh or some sketchy representation
	of the object before one moves on to the actual model. It is also possible to ask for concept art from the art director in this case. Generally an iterative workflow is recommended - saves time
	and makes sure everyone is on the same page.</P>
