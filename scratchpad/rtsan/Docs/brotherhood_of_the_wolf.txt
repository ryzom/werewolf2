Brotherhood of the Wolf
===============================

They say that the dark bortherhood is like the shadows they dwell in...

The Brotherhood of the Wolf is a secret sect of men and women in Laurelin valley (mostly). They are worshippers of the wolf-demons whose spirits dwell in the valley. In that sense they are the only living Vargfolk worshippers who do it with full knowledge. Seers generally have forgotten the source of their power. Being a seer by no means excludes one from the brotherhood, in all likelyhood it would enhance the experience.

Unlike the seers the brotherhood seeks powers mostly of the physical nature from the wolf-demons. Their goal is to be the master "hunters". Altho most skills are extremly useful for hunting, noone has mentioned what the game is. So their reputation is shady at best. Once they were public however and promoted their beliefs loudly.

Skillset:

   * Wolf Brother: (everyone, a simple ability) Permanent. Mind link with other members of the pack.  You can see their health more clearly.  You can see your brother on your radar and all the enemies he/she can see.  You can see through the eyes of your brother.  You can tell when your brother is in trouble even very far away.

   * Nighteyes: (everyone, a simple ability) Ability to see in the dark.

   * Shadow of the Moon (Lunaris Umbra): The ability to blend into shadows and remain unseen.

   * Scent of Prey: Heightened senses, especially smell. Ability to pick up the trail of anything they might be tracking.

   * The Rush of the Hunt: Adrenaline rush. Heightened strength and agility for a short amount of time.

   * Snarl: Aura of fear.

   * Heart of the Pack: (alpha male) Aura of bravery and strength.

   * The Howling: (alpha male) A powerful mental and physical attack (the 2 last ones make men the leaders of the pack).

Their most important writing is The Book of The Wolf. Which is a rather poetic writing in an elaborate orichalculum and leather binding, with a carved wolf head as decoration. This book details some of the main truths of this sect as well as how to become a Wolf Brother. It can provide clues to actually finding the sect and what advantages are to be gained by a "hunter" if they were to join the pack. Written by a brother who was most likely also a seer,

The formal dress code of the brotherhood includes mostly black robes and light armor with orange trim/ornamentation. The wolf brother symbol is tattooed on everyones hand/arm with special ink that will show up when another brother touches it.

The brotherhood generally has strong ties with the mages guild. The brotherhood also has a fairly decent role on the black market and fencing in general. Agents can be found all over the world altho they are not very numerous.

As an organization they have no grand plan really, they do have a prophecy tho, which sez that the demons will walk the earth again someday.
They have strict hierarchy and the pack generally follows what the leader wants to do.

Vargfolk use them as spies. As does the mages guild.
