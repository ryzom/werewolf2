// TODO
/////////////////////////////////

* Modular SOBs.
* Basic physics engine. CD and Response but also spear trajectory (possibly take into account wind and spear != pointmass -> rotation)
* Shader system. Henri wants enough to do lanterns, normal mapping, embers, fires and anisotropic shading.
* Tree system. This will rely on the shader system for transparency.
* Scripting system. A unified engine would be preferred but a separate engine for shaders may be necessary, needs exploring.
* GUI. Make it scriptable, update to meet current CEGUI version, and design a layout.
* Maya Plugin. Animation export, tree creation, vegetation and testing.
* Basic game logic. Throwing spears, collecting scores and guilds.
* Dumb NPCs. Horse, barkeep. Wanderers but maybe barkeep sells stuff.
* Multi-shard support. Allow us to maintain autonomous worlds for players and devs.
* Server management. Allow us to manage the services via AS/AES as well as players/customers and their characters.

// Problems
/////////////////////////////////

* Pacs and landscape before spawning
* "Soft" spawning. Async spawning with 3D fade.
* Show loading while doing first pings.
* Data based components (views, controllers etc...heavily modular SOB related).
* Error checks
	* EMD check
* Lag correction testing etc.
	* state duration?! Do we need it anymore?
* file rename CStateManager -> CStateFactory
* Program state/data -> media relationships?
	* We need to associate random data with media. Think about the amount of a bread loaf that has been eaten or the amout of damage a player has received.
	* How do we associate animations and meshes with states?
	* animations and mesh display can not just be triggered by events - think initial state.
	* We need to also associate equipment with meshes and animations.
* Mouse look? What happens to yaw events? NEEDED FOR AIMING!! (one can aim while moving)
* First time mesh loading causes lag - use async loading.
* Sticked objects
	* EMT specified attachment points - bone + transformation
* Texture handling? Changing textures, blending textures etc.
* Material handling?
