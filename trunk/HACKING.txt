HACKING Werewolf
---------------

Any fixes and additions should be sent for approval to werewolf_dev@code-bear.org
Include a description of your work and reasoning behind any major code changes,
or they may be rejected.  

When formatting code, use the following options for the GNU 'indent'
program:

  -orig -nut -di1 -ncs 

(some directories already have .indent.pro files within them)

Patches created with "cvs diff -u -w" are recommended.
