Structure

The operation is being run from Gormsby.
There exists a government district in Gormsby (formerly the palace of the kings). It is the fanciest district with heavy guard and large walls.
	In the central building resides the main body of government - the high council of commanders. Currently there are about 3-4 of the original generals and architects of the rebellion left in this council. They are around 70-80 years old. There is also a member trading guild in this council to represent the interests of the commercial community. A cleric is always present during council meetings, but is regarded only as a spiritual advisor. In reality all members of the council follow whatever the clerics say - the clerics have kind of a veto right. There has to be a representative of the celtic tribes in this council at all times. The function of the council is to preside over matters of high importance - budget, military activity and main laws.
	There are sub-councils which correspond to different key areas of the state and everyday life (economy, culture, transport etc). These councils are put together by the high council. Each member of the sub-council is specifically assigned by the high council. The main function of these councils is to compose and present new laws regarding their respective area.
	There is a house of lords which meets every week. It is composed of an elected (by members of the sub-council) official from every sub-council. They approve or disapprove new laws. The meeting is presided over by any one member of the high council. High council has veto rights over any decision of the house of lords (hence the clerics have total control).
	Due to the religious nature of the norse world, the role of the high court is given to the clerics. The high court meets every week and is composed of # of clerics who are appointed to this duty for a period of # years by the archmage. Local court is either guild based or geographically the local government official. Any cleric can stand in for a judge of higher authority than the guild law or local government. Only a cleric can choose to bring the case in front of the high court.
	Law enforcement. A large part of the law enforcement force is seer's guild based. They have the shadow clerics and peace keeping force. They are certainly represented in every large city and also travel to troubled areas. The peace keeping force is usually assigned to do a specific duty and does not interfere much with unlawful activity that they were not assigned to watch out for. Shadow clerics are sent out on very specific missions usually, however they will interfere with any unlawful or "unholy" activity that they happen to see. Government run law enforcement is mostly soldiers or ex-soldiers assigned to patrol specific areas for any unlawful activity. Their salary is paid by the people (taxes).
	Notary services are provided by local government officials with sufficient authority (usually in towns larger than a certain size).

Laws
//////////////////////////////
	Local tribal law can extend the global norse law, but it may not override the laws unless given explicit authority.
	Free man. The status of a free man is indicated by a small tattoo on the neck. Youngsters receive this tattoo when they become 14 years of age. Women can also be "free men". Slaves can not become free men. All of those who were of norse blood and were enslaved during the time of the kings have been pardoned (all who weren't nobles were practically slaves) and mostly given "free man" status. Free man status can be revoked by the court due to criminal acts.
	Slaves can be owned by anyone who can afford them (other than slaves).
	Distribution of land. Every free man (this has to be proven) can claim (ask for) a piece of land. Those that served in the rebel army have a much better chance of getting better/larger pieces of land depending on achievements in the war. Clerics can lay claim to any piece of land on religious grounds. Slaves have no right to land legally unless they have explicit documents from their owner, proving otherwise. Ultimately distribution of lands is settled by the local government. Every house already on the property must be either bought or paid rent for. Also all natural resources used on the land are taxed - unless owned privately.
	Distribution of wealth. Every free man has the right to keep anything he earns by honest means. Slaves have no right to property legally unless they have explicit documents from their owner, proving otherwise. Government has the right to impose "fair" taxes on people in order to insure their safety and wellbeing. Those who served in the rebel army have lower taxes and may get compensation from the government. Clerics have the right to impose their own taxes on the people based on their own celestial laws.
	Trade. Trade inside the norse lands is not regulated by government. Mostly controlled by the traders guild. Export and import of goods from foreign countries is taxed.
	Weapons. Every man (including slaves, unless forbidden by owner) has the right to bear a small weapon (dagger). Every man other than slaves and murderers has the right to bear medium weapons. Heavy and magical weapons can be worn by the army, the seers guild and anyone with explicity authorization from either the government or the seers guild.
	Damaging or stealing an item of value from any free man or their slave is punishable by a fine that is equivalent to triple the value of the item (there can be exceptions).
	Killing a person without justifyable cause is punishable by a payment to the family of the victim determined by the court and a loss of freedom (both the loss of the status of the free man and incarceration). If the killing was justified one must usually pay for the funeral and grief of the family.
	Injuring a person is punishable by the a payment determined by which parts of the body were injured. If the cause was justified the payment is reduced siginificantly or the victim might even be forced to pay for your stress.
	Marriage is not so much a spritual union (this is determined by local customs). It is a contract between two people that specifies the terms of wealth distribution in the case that one of them dies or goes missing. Additional wealth distribution contracts made by the dead or missing person usually override the agreement of marriage.

Methods
//////////////////////////////
	Court. Guilty until proven otherwise. The criminal has to defend himself and has the right to call witnesses to confirm his story. Usually another man has to be found guilty in order to confirm your innocence. Unsolved crimes are rare (someone is always punished). There is a minimum number of witnesses required to prove your innocence when another guilty man is not found. These witnesses also have to meet some criteria. The victim (if alive - otherwise the victims family) has the right to drop all charges (usually - unless there is considerable reason to believe that the criminal committed a truely unjustified crime).
		Freeman's word counts for more than a slaves.  slave's master can testify for what a slave saw.
	Structure
		Arbitrator - the first line to settle disputes generally...  he says "yes, this is legal or not."
		Comprised of one cleric who acts as judge and jury.
			There are regional courts who decide matters can can refer them to the high court in very rare occurances
			There is a high court who settles larger disputes of law between clans or even different countries.  This high court is run by the archmage.  If the archmage is too busy, he can send other high ranking clerics to judge in his stead.  The ruling "of god" is not appealable. :P
